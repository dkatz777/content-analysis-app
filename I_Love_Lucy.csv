Edie Adams - That's All (I Love Lucy Series Finale),W-IL4tSg1x8,MelodyOfVision,2008-06-09T06:12:42Z,"From the episode, ""Lucy Meets the Moustache"" of the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour.  The song meant so much more since it was the last episode of the popular I Love Lucy series. Lucy and Desi were also divorcing after a long tumultuous marriage. They still loved each other very much, but the problems that plagued the marriage couldn't keep them together. However, they remained friends even after they married other people, and when Desi died, Lucy was devastated. So in a sense, this song was meaningful for them both. All that they could give each other was love....that's all.

The last lines of the show....

Lucy: ""Honey, honey, I just wanted to help.""

Ricky: ""From now on, you can help me by not trying to help me. But thanks, anyway.""

---

That's All
Lyrics & Music by Alan Brandt and Bob Haymes, 1952
[brackets indicate Edie Adams' variation on the song]

I can only give you love that lasts forever
And a [the] promise to be near each time you call
And the only heart I own for you and you alone
That's all, that's all

I can only give you country walks in springtime
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And a love whose burning light will warm the winter night
That's all, that's all

There are those I am sure [who] have told you
They would give you the world for a toy
All I have are these arms to enfold you
And a love even time can't destroy
[And a love time can never destroy]

If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and evermore
That's all, that's all

[the following are not part of the original composition and what makes Edie Adams' version so special and unique]

I love you
Yes, I love you
That's all....

A Final Love Letter: Desi Arnazâ€™s Tribute to Lucille Ball

In December 1986, the world lost a comedic legend, Desi Arnaz, just days before his ex-wife and longtime creative partner, Lucille Ball, was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors. Their love story, immortalized through their groundbreaking sitcom I Love Lucy, reached a poignant conclusion in the final days of Arnazâ€™s life.

The day before his passing, Arnaz and Ball shared an intimate phone call, where they exchanged heartfelt words. â€œI love you,â€ Ball repeated, with Arnaz responding tenderly, â€œI love you too, honey.â€ It was a fitting farewell for a couple whose lives had been intertwined in love and laughter.

Unbeknownst to Ball, a special message from Arnaz was prepared to be read at the Kennedy Center Honors just five days after his death. Delivered on his behalf, it celebrated not only Ballâ€™s comedic genius but also the profound impact of their shared work.

â€œI love Lucy had just one mission: to make people laugh,â€ Arnaz wrote. â€œLucy gave it a rare quality. She could perform the wildest, even the messiest physical comedy without losing her feminine appeal.â€ Reflecting on the showâ€™s success, Arnaz humbly credited Ball, saying, â€œGive Lucy 90% of the credit and divide the other 10% among the rest of us.â€

Desi concluded his tribute with a heartfelt declaration: â€œLucy was the show. Viv and Fred and I were just props. Damn good props, but props nevertheless. P.S. I Love Lucy was never just a title.â€

Arnazâ€™s words resonated as a testament to their love and partnership, a final love letter to the woman who was his muse, collaborator, and enduring friend. Even in his absence, Desi Arnazâ€™s admiration for Lucille Ball continues to echo, a reminder of their shared legacy in the hearts of fans worldwide.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Owen (Cuba Gooding Jr.) tolerates a bus full of Lucille Ball impersonators and the distaster that ensues.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
A very loose remake of the classic multi-star comedy It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963), this madcap comedy is directed by Jerry Zucker, one third of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker comedy team and director of Ghost (1990). John Cleese stars as an eccentric casino owner who devises a contest pitting six teams against each other in a race to claim two million dollars from a locker in New Mexico. The competitors are Owen (Cuba Gooding Jr., who ends up driving a bus full of Lucille Ball imitators, a foreigner (Rowan Atkinson) who hitches a ride in an organ donor vehicle, and a recently reunited mother and daughter (Whoopi Goldberg and Lanei Chapman) who anger a ""squirrel lady"" (Kathy Bates) -- much to their regret. There are also two con artist brothers (Seth Green and Vince Vieluf), the upright Nick (Breckin Meyer), who gets a lift from cute but psychotic pilot Tracy (Amy Smart), and the eccentric Pear family, headed up by Jon Lovitz. Rat Race also stars Dave Thomas, Kathy Najimy, Wayne Knight, Dean Cain, and Paul Rodriguez.

This I Love Lucy Episode Was BANNED for 10 Years,c-M5mu01C9E,Facts Verse,2020-07-07T16:00:13Z,"I Love Lucy is an American multinational television sitcom that originally ran on CBS from October 15, 1951 to May 6, 1957, with a total of 180 half-hour episodes spanning six seasons. The show, which was the first scripted television program to be shot on 35mm film in front of a studio audience, by cinematographer Karl Freund, won five Emmy Awards and received numerous nominations and honors. It was the first show ever to feature an ensemble cast. It is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms in history. In 2012, it was voted the 'Best TV Show of All Time' in a survey conducted by ABC News and People magazine. 
 
Even though it was immensely popular, I Love Lucy still encountered controversy when one of its episodes had to be pulled from syndication. The episode was called ""The Ricardos Visit Cuba"". This episode was a fun and innocent trip for the Ricardo family, who traveled to Cuba to visit family. Due to political tensions at the time, networks and even some of the show's producers were concerned that the episode would be too controversial. As a result, it was taken off the air immediately following its first run. The rest of I Love Lucy continued without any issues, and ten years later, this controversial episode would return to televisions.

Make sure you watch the whole video, as we also take a look at one of the other controversial moments in I Love Lucy history - Lucy's pregnancy. Lucy was the first pregnant woman to be shown on television, a decision that would solidify the show's place in history while shaping the future of television. In this video, we'll look at how this decision came to be, and how it was handled by the cast, producers and audiences.

The episode begins with Lucy, Ricky, Fred, and Ethel on their way to Hollywood in their trusty trailer. However, they find themselves stranded in a small town in Tennessee when their car breaks down. With no money to fix the car, they come up with the idea of putting on a show to raise the funds they need to continue their journey.

Lucy and Ethel decide to put on a hillbilly act, and they set out to find the right costumes and props. However, their search proves more difficult than they anticipated, and they end up causing chaos in a local store while trying on outfits.

Meanwhile, Ricky and Fred try to recruit some local talent for the show. They find a group of enthusiastic volunteers, but their lack of experience makes it clear that this won't be an easy performance.

As the big night approaches, Lucy and Ethel struggle with their hillbilly accents, and things seem to be falling apart. However, their performance ends up being a hit, and the audience loves it. They raise enough money to fix the car and continue on their journey to Hollywood.

Throughout the episode, Lucille Ball's comedic talents are on full display as she delivers her trademark physical humor and impeccable timing. The chemistry between the cast is evident as they work together to create a hilarious and heartwarming episode.

In conclusion, ""Tennessee Bound"" is a classic episode of ""I Love Lucy"" that continues to be beloved by fans of the show and lovers of classic television. Its timeless humor and heartwarming moments are a testament to the enduring appeal of Lucille Ball and the talented cast of ""I Love Lucy"".

The show is still syndicated in dozens of languages across the world, and remains popular, with an American audience of 40 million each year. A colorized version of its Christmas episode attracted more than eight million viewers when CBS aired it in prime time in 2013 - 62 years after the show premiered.

A second colorized special, featuring the ""L.A. At Last!"" and ""Lucy and Superman"" episodes, aired on May 17, 2015, attracting 6.4 million viewers.

A Final Love Letter: Desi Arnazâ€™s Tribute to Lucille Ball

In December 1986, the world lost a comedic legend, Desi Arnaz, just days before his ex-wife and longtime creative partner, Lucille Ball, was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors. Their love story, immortalized through their groundbreaking sitcom I Love Lucy, reached a poignant conclusion in the final days of Arnazâ€™s life.

The day before his passing, Arnaz and Ball shared an intimate phone call, where they exchanged heartfelt words. â€œI love you,â€ Ball repeated, with Arnaz responding tenderly, â€œI love you too, honey.â€ It was a fitting farewell for a couple whose lives had been intertwined in love and laughter.

Unbeknownst to Ball, a special message from Arnaz was prepared to be read at the Kennedy Center Honors just five days after his death. Delivered on his behalf, it celebrated not only Ballâ€™s comedic genius but also the profound impact of their shared work.

â€œI love Lucy had just one mission: to make people laugh,â€ Arnaz wrote. â€œLucy gave it a rare quality. She could perform the wildest, even the messiest physical comedy without losing her feminine appeal.â€ Reflecting on the showâ€™s success, Arnaz humbly credited Ball, saying, â€œGive Lucy 90% of the credit and divide the other 10% among the rest of us.â€

Desi concluded his tribute with a heartfelt declaration: â€œLucy was the show. Viv and Fred and I were just props. Damn good props, but props nevertheless. P.S. I Love Lucy was never just a title.â€

Arnazâ€™s words resonated as a testament to their love and partnership, a final love letter to the woman who was his muse, collaborator, and enduring friend. Even in his absence, Desi Arnazâ€™s admiration for Lucille Ball continues to echo, a reminder of their shared legacy in the hearts of fans worldwide.

Vance also faced challenges in her relationship with William Frawley, who played her on-screen husband, Fred Mertz. Despite their on-screen chemistry, Vance and Frawley had a complex relationship off-screen. Frawley, considerably older than Vance, had initial reservations about playing her husband due to the age difference. Additionally, Frawley's sometimes unpredictable behavior caused occasional tensions between the two. However, they set aside their personal conflicts during filming and delivered convincing performances as the endearing couple Fred and Ethel Mertz. Beyond the challenges, Vance's talent and comedic skills on ""I Love Lucy"" left an indelible mark. 

Her portrayal of Ethel Mertz, a loyal and supportive friend to Lucy Ricardo, showcased her impeccable comedic timing, deadpan delivery, and ability to hold her own alongside the comedic genius of Lucille Ball. Vance's performance added depth and humor to the show, creating a beloved dynamic duo that remains iconic to this day. Vivian Vance's legacy as an actress extends far beyond her work on ""I Love Lucy."" Her talent and versatility were evident in her other roles, both on stage and screen. She demonstrated her range in theater productions and made notable appearances on various television shows. Vance's ability to captivate audiences with her comedic prowess, combined with her dramatic skills, solidifies her status as a versatile and accomplished actress.

Desi Arnaz Refused to Film This I Love Lucy Scene,ZOKpanvG3WA,Facts Verse,2021-05-01T23:00:07Z,"Desi Arnaz was an entertainer that came to America from Cuba at a young age and found success on television alongside his partner Lucille Ball. Together, the two starred in the hit show I Love Lucy, which ran for six seasons throughout the 1950s. The two each gave their all to their respective comedic performances on the show. However, there was one particular line that Desi refused to cross over the course of the showâ€™s run due to strong personal beliefs.

Desi was born in the early 20th century, and his father was the mayor of the second-largest city in Cuba. While this gave young Desi a life of relative ease during his early years, the 1933 Cuban Revolution put an abrupt end to that luxury during the young starâ€™s teenage years. The revolution found his father imprisoned by revolutionaries. Desiâ€™s family was able to free his father, but they were then forced to flee to America. Knowing none of the wealth that they were accustomed to in Cuba, the family was forced to work their way up. They made a living cleaning canary cages and doing other small jobs, allowing Desi to eventually work his way up to becoming the successful performer he became known as.

While these struggles could have made the young Desi grown into a bitter adult, they instead instilled a sense of wonder in the man about the possibilities provided by America to immigrant families such as his. Desi soon became a gigantic patriot and a vocal supporter of the American dream, always maintaining a strong work ethic.

Desi also had other values instilled in him at childhood, and some of these werenâ€™t as positive as his beliefs in hard work and the American dream. He adamantly believed that a woman should be subservient to a man in a marriage, and this hurt his personal relationship with his costar and wife Lucille Ball. Lucille has recalled instances during their marriage where Desiâ€™s personal beliefs got in the way of her happiness, eventually causing the marriage to dissolve. Whether right or wrong, Desi always adamantly stood for his own personal beliefs. Join Facts Verse as we explore why Desi Arnaz refused to film this I Love Lucy scene.

I Love Lucy was trailblazing series that introduced the world to the talents of Lucille Ball and her then-husband Desi Arnaz. While the series would get its start when Ball and Arnaz were still married, by the end of its run, cracks would form in their relationship that would eventually lead to its end.

After being on the air for six seasons and 180 half-hour episodes, the highly-influential and beloved American sitcom I Love Lucy wrapped up with somewhat of an anticlimactic series finale on May 6, 1957. The stars of I Love Lucy, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, William Frawley, and Vivian Vance had developed quite a following of devoted fans in the time that the show they helped create was on the airwaves. And when it was time for us all to bid them farewell, it was a very bittersweet moment indeed.

Join Facts verse as we take a look at the final episode of the pioneering series. We'll discuss the several I Love Lucy spin-off shows that filled some of that hole that was left in the hearts of fans after the series went off the air. And if you're curious about whether or not Lucille Ball's and Desi Arnez's divorce played any kind of role in the show's run time, we'll be covering that as well.

Desi Arnaz - I Love Lucy (Columbia Records 1953),_g4-FqbWh9w,RoundMidnightTV,2011-01-02T12:56:32Z,"""I Love Lucy"" is the title song to the television sitcom.  The music was written as an instrumental with lyrics written by Harold Adamson, who was nominated five times for an Oscar. The lyrics to ""I Love Lucy"" were sung by Desi Arnaz in the episode ""Lucy's Last Birthday"".

I Love Lucy is a landmark American television sitcom starring Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, and William Frawley. The black-and-white series originally ran from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957, on CBS. After the series ended in 1957, however, a modified version continued for three more seasons with 13 one-hour specials, running from 1957 to 1960, known first as The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show and later in reruns as The Lucy--Desi Comedy Hour.

I Love Lucy was the most watched show in the United States in four of its six seasons, and was the first to end its run at the top of the Nielsen ratings (an accomplishment later matched by The Andy Griffith Show and Seinfeld). I Love Lucy is still syndicated in dozens of languages across the world. A colorized version of its Christmas episode attracted more than 8 million viewers when CBS aired it in prime time in 2013 -- 62 years after the show premiered.

The show was the first scripted television program to be shot on 35 mm film in front of a studio audience, and won five Emmy Awards and received numerous nominations. Another award that the show won was the coveted George Foster Peabody Award for ""recognition of distinguished achievement in television."" In 2002, it ranked second on TV Guide's list of television's greatest shows, behind Seinfeld and ahead of The Honeymooners. In 2007, it was listed as one of Time magazine's ""100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME."" I Love Lucy remains popular, with an American audience of 40 million each year.

(Lucy, Iove Lucy)

I love Lucy and she loves me.
We're as happy as two can be.
 We quarrel but then.
How we love making up again.
Lucy kisses like now one can.
She's my misses and I'm her man.
And life is heaven you see.
Cause I love Lucy.
Yes I love Lucy
And Lucy loves me.

Chorus

When CBS colorizes something, they take the time to go frame by frame. This video is colorized by artificial intelligence, and although it's gotten very good at pictures, it still has some ways to go with video. Because of this, I feel the colors look muted and very warm. In the future, I will continue to upload my I Love Lucy In Color Series (which is colorized by CBS and looks perfect) and will also upload my black and white best moment series (as there are way more episodes that are only in black and white then those colorized). When I upload a black and white video, I will upload a colorized version as well, it won't look amazing but think of it like a bonus.

This is the first video in my series I Love Lucy Best Moments: Part 1, now newly colorized by me! Below is a little guide because I know these titles can start to get confusing:

I Love Lucy is an American television sitcom that originally aired on CBS from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957, with a total of 180 half-hour episodes, spanning six seasons. The show starred Lucille Ball, her husband, Desi Arnaz, along with Vivian Vance and William Frawley. The series followed the life of Lucy Ricardo (Ball), a young, middle-class housewife living in New York City, who often concocted plans with her best friends and landlords, Ethel and Fred Mertz (Vance and Frawley), to appear alongside her bandleader husband, Ricky Ricardo (Arnaz), in his nightclub. Lucy is depicted trying numerous schemes to mingle with and be a part of show business. After the series ended in 1957, a modified version of the show continued for three more seasons, with 13 one-hour specials, which ran from 1957 to 1960. It was first known as The Lucille Ballâ€“Desi Arnaz Show, and later, in reruns, as The Lucyâ€“Desi Comedy Hour.

I Love Lucy Best Moments Part 2: Now in Color!,vwJTZvqmmX0,Ross117,2022-02-11T23:00:10Z,"Note about Colorization: This video is colorized by me, not CBS. When CBS colorizes something, they take the time to go frame by frame. This video is colorized by artificial intelligence, and although it's gotten very good at pictures, it still has some ways to go with video. Because of this, I feel the colors look muted and very warm. In the future, I will continue to upload my I Love Lucy In Color Series (which is colorized by CBS and looks perfect) and will also upload my black and white best moment series (as there are way more episodes that are only in black and white then those colorized). When I upload a black and white video, I will upload a colorized version as well, it won't look amazing but think of it like a bonus.

This is the second video in my series, I Love Lucy Best Moments: Part 2, now newly colorized by me! Below is a little guide because I know these titles can start to get confusing:

In 2014, we crowdfunded $11k to start the process to create the first ever Vietnamese Australian Family comedy webseries in the world. In December 2017 we filmed the whole webseries in 7 days all in Springvale. In February 2018, we crowdfunded over $17k for post production, making the total $28k in total, and we knew it would not be enough for the quality we were dreaming of, so we applied for Screen Australia funding, and in April 2019, SA funded us $52k to finish the webseries.
We finally released the first ever series on June 16th 2019. Thank you to over 200 crowdfunders from all over the world. You made this happen.","Phi And Me,Phi and Me webseries,Asian Australian show,Being Asian Australian,parent be like,asian parents be like,I love lucy liu,Phi And Me Tv,Lucy liu,vietnamese,vietnam,Vietnamese comedy,tiger mum,tv show,funny asian people,comedy,Diana nguyen,karaoke,kim huong,Vietnamese food,vietnamese mum,tough mum,tough love,sewing mum,Vietnamese love story,A plus,coming of age,storyteller,nguyen,Ali wong,community channel,Anna akana",23,38453,701,96,PT13M43S,hd,public

Peel back the curtains and step onto the set of one of America's most beloved sitcoms, ""I Love Lucy"". In this video, we explore a lesser-known side of the classic show - the behind-the-scenes tensions and the personalities that drove them. While ""I Love Lucy"" offered an idyllic portrayal of 1950s America on-screen, the off-screen dynamics were far from perfect.

Our spotlight shines on William Frawley, the talented actor behind the gruff yet lovable character, Fred Mertz. Notorious for his difficult behavior and unreasonable demands, Frawley's interactions with his fellow cast members were often tense, marked by conflict, and overshadowed by his struggles with alcoholism. Despite these challenges, Frawley's performance remains an integral part of the enduring charm of ""I Love Lucy.""

Join us as we delve deep into Frawley's contentious relationships, his impact on the show, and how he was viewed by his fellow cast members. Discover how the off-screen drama contributed to the on-screen magic and the legacy of this iconic series. After discussing Frawleyâ€™s time on I Love Lucy, weâ€™ll then move on to addressing how the actor managed to regain the dignity that he felt he had lost while appearing on that series in his follow-up roles. If youâ€™re a fan of Frawley and I Love Lucy, this is one video that you wonâ€™t want to miss!

Scenes from I Love Lucy 'Fred and Ethel Fight' Colorized! (As seen in 'Being the Ricardos'),uG-lTllRF_g,Ross117,2022-01-21T05:00:10Z,"Hello! In this video I colorized the scenes from 'Fred and Ethel Fight' that were seen in the movie 'Being the Ricardos'. I feel like comparing the scenes side by side with the movie is very interesting with the scenes now in color. One thing I did notice is that in the movie the apartment used is the Ricardo's second, while when the actual episode was filmed, they were still in their first apartment (you can tell by the window in the back). This colorization and all my videos are only possible due to support from viewers like you. You can support me at 'buymeacoffee.com/ross117'. See you all soon!

Note about Colorization: This video is colorized by me, not CBS. When CBS colorizes something, they take the time to go frame by frame. This video is colorized by artificial intelligence, and although it's gotten very good at pictures, it still has some ways to go with video. Because of this, I feel the colors look muted and very warm. In the future, I will continue to upload my I Love Lucy In Color Series (which is colorized by CBS and looks perfect) and will also upload my black and white best moment series (as there are way more episodes that are only in black and white then those colorized). When I upload a black and white video, I will upload a colorized version as well, it won't look amazing but think of it like a bonus.","I Love Lucy,I Luv Lucy,Being the Ricardos",23,26203,360,45,PT4M15S,sd,public

"""I Love Lucy"" Philip Morris Advertisements/Sponsor Placement (1952)",gP_bLYwXBpI,Windows OS,2019-04-14T19:40:42Z,"Lemme get this out of the way first: These commercials are being posted for historical purposes only, not as a condonation or advertisement for cigarette smoking. I do not condone, in anyway whatsoever, smoking tobacco products. Smoking's bullshit folks, and it's bad for ya. Just don't do it. Lemme also note that Dezi Arnez eventually died of lung cancer due to his smoking in 1986 at the age of 69, with Lucille Ball also dying a few years after due to an abdominal aneurysm, which her smoking increased her risk of. Make of that what you will.

However, these commercials and sponsor spots for Philip Morris Cigarettes from the I Love Lucy episodes ""Job Switching"" (aka that episode where Lucy and Vivian Vance fuck around at a candy factory) and Lucy Does a TV Commercial (aka that episode where Lucy gets drunk off of ""Vitameatavegamin"" while trying to film a commercial for it) are still a very interesting piece of television history, as it is basically an artifact from a different time, back when this type of blatant advertising for tobacco was not only present but commonplace in television, along with seeing a show just being soaked in sponsor placement, with, in this case, Philip Morris cartons or that annoying ""CALL FOR PHILIP MORRIS"" guy (fun fact: he was not a kid when these originally aired. He was 42) in the opening titles or the closing credits, along with Lucille Ball and Dezi Arnez smoking them. All of this seems just completely ludicrous to any of us who hasn't lived through this time, not even just the fact that it's all for fucking cigarettes, but seeing such blatant product placement period, while nowadays Geoff Keighley being surrounded by Mountain Dew and Doritos in a interview (remember that?) becomes a meme. But, that's what makes old cigarette commercials so fucking interesting. It's a fascinating slice of a very different era.

From the Criterion Television Classics LaserDisc release of I Love Lucy.

I Love Lucy | Lucy is worried that their unborn child will someday ask a lot of difficult questions,mAFYcsQ0_-Y,Kinette,2023-12-04T20:00:18Z,"Lucy is worried that their unborn child will someday ask a lot of difficult questions, so she hires a tutor to teach her, Ricky, and the Mertzes.

I Love Lucy is an American television sitcom starring Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, and William Frawley. The black-and-white series originally ran from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957, on CBS. All 180 episodes aired on Mondays.

In total 180 episodes of I Love Lucy were produced, plus a pilot episode. The pilot, which was not made for broadcast and did not air as part of the show's original run, is generally not counted as one of the episodes and therefore listed separately for reference. It is, however, available on DVD and Blu-ray releases of the first season. Following I Love Lucy, a further 13 one hour-long episodes were produced under the title of The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show (later and more commonly known in syndication as The Lucyâ€“Desi Comedy Hour) with the same cast and later packaged as seasons 7, 8 & 9 under the I Love Lucy series.","i love lucy episode,i love you,i love you lucy,i love lucy chocolate,i love lucy chocolate factory,i love lucy song,i love lucy show,lucy show,i love lucy vitameatavegamin,vitameatavegamin,i love lucy season 1,i love lucy ricky,lucy in the sky,i love lucy theme,i love it,i love lucy movie,lucy movie,lucy in the sky with diamonds,i love lucy theme song,i love lucy episode 1,i love lucy baby,the i love lucy show,the lucy show,i love lucy part 1",1,15604,221,18,PT4M58S,sd,public

I Love Lucy is an American television sitcom starring Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, and William Frawley. The black-and-white series originally ran from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957, on CBS. All 180 episodes aired on Mondays.

In total 180 episodes of I Love Lucy were produced, plus a pilot episode. The pilot, which was not made for broadcast and did not air as part of the show's original run, is generally not counted as one of the episodes and therefore listed separately for reference. It is, however, available on DVD and Blu-ray releases of the first season. Following I Love Lucy, a further 13 one hour-long episodes were produced under the title of The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show (later and more commonly known in syndication as The Lucyâ€“Desi Comedy Hour) with the same cast and later packaged as seasons 7, 8 & 9 under the I Love Lucy series.","i love lucy episode,i love you,i love you lucy,i love lucy chocolate,i love lucy chocolate factory,i love lucy song,i love lucy show,lucy show,i love lucy vitameatavegamin,vitameatavegamin,i love lucy season 1,i love lucy ricky,lucy in the sky,i love lucy theme,i love it,i love lucy movie,lucy movie,lucy in the sky with diamonds,i love lucy theme song,i love lucy episode 1,i love lucy baby,the i love lucy show,the lucy show,i love lucy part 1",1,14895,177,7,PT4M44S,sd,public

I Love Lucy had lots of bloopers and goofs that were left in to the final show. They didn't like to do scenes over again so many times they just went with it which made the episodes more fresh. It also insured that the audience reaction was more energetic. See Lucille Ball, William Frawley, and Desi Arnaz get involved in bloopers and goofs that sometimes involved their mistakes and sometimes involved problems with the cameras and props that were visible when they weren't supposed to be.

Also, in this video we look at Ricky Ricardo's magic hat, the fishing boat incident that feels like it happened near the Bermuda Triangle, the rigged car accident with Lucy and Ethel. See how Lucy ad libs to handle mistakes during scenes, and more.

"(I LOVE LUCY) Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum in Jamestown, NY",8aTpn2wHU0Y,Elevated Vlogs,2020-07-26T14:03:47Z,"In this vlog we toured the famous ""Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum"" also known as the ""Lucy Desi Museum"" in Jamestown, NY. Its located on the corner of North Main St & West 3rd, just a few minutes away from the National Comedy Center. They offer daily passes for both if you're interested in touring them in the same day!

This wonderful museum honors Lucille Ball's & Desi Arnaz's careers on ""I Love Lucy"" and even highlights their accomplishments & achievements throughout their life. We think that this place is definitely worth the trip if you want to experience what it feels like behind the scenes on their film sets, & how they became so successful in their lives. Its so packed full of memorabilia & information that you could learn a lot about them just by visiting here.

We hope that our video helps promote this museum as well as the National Comedy Center & most importantly helps honor Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz.

I Love Lucy | Lucy is determined to get a new designer dress while in Paris,h6iZ0YfkPvo,Kinette,2024-08-12T19:00:27Z,"Lucy is determined to get a new designer dress while in Paris.

I Love Lucy is an American television sitcom starring Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, and William Frawley. The black-and-white series originally ran from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957, on CBS. All 180 episodes aired on Mondays.

In total 180 episodes of I Love Lucy were produced, plus a pilot episode. The pilot, which was not made for broadcast and did not air as part of the show's original run, is generally not counted as one of the episodes and therefore listed separately for reference. It is, however, available on DVD and Blu-ray releases of the first season. Following I Love Lucy, a further 13 one hour-long episodes were produced under the title of The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show (later and more commonly known in syndication as The Lucyâ€“Desi Comedy Hour) with the same cast and later packaged as seasons 7, 8 & 9 under the I Love Lucy series.","i love lucy episode,i love you,i love you lucy,i love lucy chocolate,i love lucy chocolate factory,i love lucy song,i love lucy show,lucy show,i love lucy vitameatavegamin,vitameatavegamin,i love lucy season 1,i love lucy ricky,lucy in the sky,i love lucy theme,i love it,i love lucy movie,lucy movie,lucy in the sky with diamonds,i love lucy theme song,i love lucy episode 1,i love lucy baby,the i love lucy show,the lucy show,i love lucy part 1",1,9980,238,17,PT4M59S,sd,public

La letra cuenta de un chico que trata de conquistar a Lucy. Sin embargo es en vano ya que ella no lo nota. Ella sale con chicos con dinero y bien vestidos. No como el protagonista que viste con ropa que usaron sus familiares. Al final el prota dice que no le importa. Esto es desarrollo de personaje.

I Love Lucy is celebrated for its groundbreaking approach to television comedy, but not every episode was met with open arms. ""The Ricardos Visit Cuba"" was pulled from syndication due to its sensitive portrayal of Cuban culture and the political climate of the time. As we unpack the historical context, you'll learn about the challenges the show's creators faced in balancing humor with real-world issues. We'll also discuss the impact of advertiser influence on television content and how this episode's suppression reflects broader themes of censorship and creative control in media.

Join us as we explore the behind-the-scenes decisions that led to the banning of this episode and its eventual place in I Love Lucy lore. From the complexities of portraying an interracial family to the show's pioneering efforts in addressing contemporary issues, this story offers a unique glimpse into the evolution of television.

I love Lucy Set Recreation - Part I,pA0V5Qf2aYg,Mr. Phraust,2025-01-03T14:14:24Z,"Watch me work on my ""I Love Lucy"" 3D set recreation of the main apartment set from Seasons 1-2. (New live streams every week!)

In this episode: I started out working on a ceramic piece Lucy had hanging on the kitchen pass-through window. I found quickly I needed more measurements and I was not ready to model this.

I moved on to the window above the stove and began modeling that and made pretty good headway with it. I'll complete the window and move on to another area in another video.

About the project: This is an attempt to make the most accurate and detailed recreation of the Ricardo's Apartment (4A) from seasons 1-2 ever created. From the trim on the walls to the dials on the stove - everything is painstakingly recreated to preserve this iconic piece of TV history.

From season 1 to nearly the end of season 2 the Ricardo's lived in apartment 4A, in a typical brownstone apartment on East 68th Street in New York City. It was smaller and more cramped than their later apartment, which they moved into shortly after Lucy gave birth to little Ricky near the end of season 2.",,20,14,0,1,PT2H2M25S,hd,public
