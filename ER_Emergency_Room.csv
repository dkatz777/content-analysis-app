New Pediatric ER at Shands will enhance emergency care for children,lAlEXcqA-Jc,UF Health,2011-06-22T19:13:40Z,"Children are not small adults. This is never more evident than when an accident or urgent medical problem arises and parents need fast access to specialized care designed to meet their child's needs.

On July 1, the new Pediatric Emergency Room at Shands Hospital for Children at the University of Florida will open, becoming north central Florida's first emergency room specifically geared toward kids.

Located at Shands at the University of Florida, the Pediatric ER will have a separate entrance with free valet parking for adults transporting children, and an adjacent parking garage for visitors. Calming, child-friendly dÃ©cor with a nautical theme enhances the check-in and waiting areas, with porthole windows, saltwater aquariums and floors made to look like waves adding to the atmosphere.

More important, families will have access to an expanded team of UF pediatric emergency medicine physicians and Shands pediatric emergency-trained nurses, additional treatment space and the latest medical technology.

""This new Pediatric ER benefits our patients and our UF&Shands teams,"" said Jennifer Light, M.D., UF College of Medicine clinical assistant professor of emergency medicine and Pediatric ER medical director. ""We've created an environment just for families, staffed by people committed to the care of children. This generates great positive energy and the opportunity for us to improve services and the whole experience for young patients and their families.""

The Pediatric ER will be staffed by seven UF board-certified or board-eligible pediatric emergency medicine physicians and 22 Shands pediatric-trained emergency medicine registered nurses. The team will be able to treat up to 24,000 pediatric emergency patients a year.","062211,Peds,ER,RibbonCutting",25,751517,229,3,PT1M33S,sd,public

SKADESTUEN har vundet adskillige EmmyÂ®-priser og foregÃ¥r pÃ¥ Chicago County General Hospital -- en serie, der fortsÃ¦tter i samme Ã¥nd som den tidligere Hill Street Blues. Ligesom Hill Street Blues byder Skadestuen pÃ¥ en rÃ¦kke stÃ¦rke karakterer, hvis kaotiske arbejdsliv ofte afspejler sig i deres privatliv. Serien byder ogsÃ¥ pÃ¥ en rap og lÃ¦kker blanding af komedie, intriger og tragedie. Den kan ogsÃ¥ ses som forlÃ¸beren for The West Wing pÃ¥ den mÃ¥de, at vi med forundring ser, hvordan karaktererne formÃ¥r at holde sig oven vande i dette hverdagskaos og klare de mange problemer, de konstant mÃ¸der. PÃ¥ skadestuen kan kaosset vÃ¦re lig med narkomaner, voldelige patienter, der brager gennem glasdÃ¸re, hÃ¦vngerrige kolleger eller en chefkirurg, der insisterer pÃ¥, at hans kolleger skal operere hans syge hund.
FÃ¸rste sÃ¦son er bedst kendt for at introducere George Clooney som den sympatiske, men temmeligt uafhÃ¦ngige dr. Ross, og serien har ofte budt pÃ¥ gÃ¦stestjerner som Sally Field og Ewan McGregor. I andre sÃ¦soner har vi set forskellige karakterer komme og gÃ¥. Men hvis der er Ã©n karakter, der personificerer styrken ved Skadestuen, er det dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards). Han er sÃ¥ dedikeret til sit arbejde, at han har takket nej til lukrative og behagelige tilbud i den private sektor, og han er indbegrebet af ordentlighed, uselviskhed og fÃ¸lelsesmÃ¦ssig stabilitet.

I chose emergency medicine bc the ER is a safety net for vulnerable patients #postshiftmusings,BwgR4qHPO0g,Being Dr. Bernice,2022-01-15T14:35:54Z,"I chose to go into emergency medicine because I have a strong commitment to serving our society's poorest and most vulnerable communities. The ER is often the only place that these patients can access healthcare. There are many times that we as clinicians have to take extra time in order to provide the detailed care that our most vulnerable patients deserve. Even in the moments that this feels burdensome, I always re-center my mind and remind myself that this is precisely why I wanted to come into this field.ï¿¼ï¿¼

Part 1 - My Trip to the ER (Emergency Room) - Life with Jessica (mostly Spanish video),7GOvKH_-5LE,SELVA inglÃ©s,2013-07-22T19:19:35Z,"Hi guys, As you see, this isn't my typical ""English"" video. Well, it's really not an English video at all, but about me and my health issues. I've been suffering from chronic (non-stop) lower back pain for over two years now and I can't handle it anymore. I'm changing the way SELVA is done to comply my new lifestyle. I hope you like it and enjoy this journey with me and learn English while you do it!

Will I still make more English lessons like grammar and recommendations? 

Yes, of course. I love teaching...especially grammar, but in order for me to understand how to teach you grammar it takes a lot of thinking on my end and I'm just not capable right now (mostly due to my lack of sleep). If you'd like more structured English lessons, I recommend JenniferESL. She is always professional. 

In this video I am completely wacked out. I had several severe side effects from a new medicine, Cymbalta, that the doctor put me on to see if it would help my pain. It did...I was pain free for about two hours the day I filmed this video, but it's also the last day I took the medicine that was sending me into mania....literally. 

My mama said that this isn't ""me"" in the video. But it is me...I'm just sick. She advised me not to post these three videos, but I feel strongly about the need to NOT be private about my health anymore. I was always so scared to get the healthcare I needed...that is...until I couldn't put it off (wait) any longer. 

When I found out I was depressed and had social anxiety (not on video, thank goodness) I started taking Paxil and it has honestly changed my life. I feel like I gained ten years of maturity in just a few months. I'm not advocating taking drugs. What I am doing is speaking up about getting the help you need.","Hospital,Jessica,hospital room,emergency room,cymbalta,cymbalta made me crazy,side effects",22,4909,71,37,PT1M5S,sd,public

""Join me as I navigate through a particularly intense shift in the emergency department. This day was filled with a myriad of cases - from managing an elderly patient with altered consciousness to handling a critical cardiac arrest case. 

We start with the admission of an elderly woman, whose consciousness did not improve despite our best efforts, necessitating intubation. This was followed by a highly urgent situation - a patient brought in with a cardiac arrest due to opium poisoning. Despite our resuscitation efforts, we tragically weren't able to save them.

Later in the day, we encountered a patient suffering from ventricular arrhythmia and palpitations, a serious condition that required quick action. With the administration of two timely shocks, we were able to stabilize them.

This video provides a snapshot of the challenging and unpredictable nature of working in an emergency room. The rapid pace, the life-or-death decisions, and the sheer variety of cases we handle are what makes this job both extremely demanding and incredibly rewarding.","Cardiac arrest,Emergency room,cardiac arrest symptoms,day in the life,emergancy,emergancy room,emergency,emergency room visit,emergency room vlog,er,heart attack,hospital,mommy vlogger,rushed to the emergency room,rushed to the hospital,rushing to the emergency room,sudden cardiac arrest",27,1569,21,1,PT1M1S,hd,public

In the ER there is a trained Triage Nurse to asses each person who enters the emergency room. The Triage nurses assesses the severity of your injury or sickness by observing the patients ability to walk, breathing, pain and other things. The triage nurse follows an algorithm called the ESI - Emergency Severity Index.

How Common are Emergency Room Mistakes? #accidentlawyer #legalhelpmiami #accidentlawyermiami,RGnujHiWkyc,Kaire & Heffernan | Injury Lawyer Miami,2024-07-04T19:33:33Z,"ER Mistakes: A Closer Look at Miami Hospitals
Emergency rooms are vital for urgent care, but even in Miami's renowned medical centers, mistakes can happen. While most ER visits go smoothly, data shows that errors are more common than you might think:
Misdiagnosis: Studies suggest 5.7% of all ER visits nationwide involve misdiagnosis, affecting over 7 million patients annually. This is a particular concern in Miami, where the fast pace of ERs can sometimes lead to rushed decisions.
Medication Errors: These occur in approximately 6.7% of hospitalized patients, potentially causing adverse drug events, allergic reactions, and even death.
Delayed Treatment: A 2023 study found average ER wait times in Miami exceeding 2 hours, raising concerns about patients not receiving timely care for critical conditions.
Know Your Rights as a Patient
If you or a loved one believe you've been harmed due to an ER error in a Miami hospital, it's important to understand your rights. You may be entitled to compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering.
The experienced team at Kaire & Heffernan has over 30 years of experience handling medical malpractice cases in Miami. We can help you investigate your situation and determine if you have a valid claim.

Julian Xane Phillips Rendition of Brian Reganâ€™s - ER Emergency Room,MzPXpa7tOiQ,Independent OPTAVIA Coach Stacy Phillips ,2019-08-07T17:56:57Z,"Julian is our son, and he got a kidney transplant when he was three. He is on the Spectrum for Autism, and this is somewhat of a Speech Therapy/Occupational Therapy for him. We went on a cruise to the Bahamas last week and found an empty stage/room mid-day. Hereâ€™s what happened! Love this boy!

Julian gives a bit of stand-up humor â€œborrowedâ€ from Brian Regan on stage on the Carnival Liberty. It was mid-day and I was his only audience. This is from Brian Reganâ€™s â€œI Walked in the Moonâ€ Comedy Show, and is Julianâ€™s rendition of the Emergency Room or ER. When we took Julian TO the ER 6 months ago for anemia, he watched that portion over and over, he laughed and laughed, and it made the 6 hour stay more enjoyable. 

*I do not own the rights to this original Brian Regan material, it is a â€œcoverâ€ impersonation performance and he had zero audience except me (his mom), and this brought me great joy so I wanted to share it. Hopefully it can inspire children and adults who are on the Autism Spectrum and raise awareness for how unique and special each individual on the planet truly is.

Brian Regan is one of Julianâ€™s heroes, and we just bought tickets to see him on Dec 31st 2019 in Phoenix. If you see this, Brian, please wave at Julian, heâ€™ll be in Section 8, seat 3 or 4! Lol!","Autism,comedy,stand-up comedy,autism awareness,Brian Regan",26,184,1,0,PT5M49S,hd,public

I was too in my head over thinking and mindlessly walked too fast down the stairs.

Slipped fucked up my body my back, ribs, and pacemaker all flared up in crazy sharp pains, came to ER to get everything checked out.

I will get back up on my feet and fight another day tomorrow, with more Breath, taking life moment to moment, in Gratitude, and Presence of mind.

Gratefully the Docs conclude I strained and bruised my rib, chest and back muscles. Structurally everything looks sound and no internal bleeding, breaks, or rips.

Thank you God.","er,emergency room,i am not being present,get out of my head,over thinking,presence of mind,ct scan,pacemaker check,hospitalization,live from the er",27,132,4,2,PT1M4S,hd,public

Billedkunstner Thierry Geoffroy / Colonel arbejder med udstillinger og kunstformater, der forholder sig prompte til nutiden. I den forbindelse har han introduceret begrebet â€œThe Ultracontemporaryâ€.
Her fÃ¸lger billedserie med et udvalg af kunstnerens udsagn de sidste to mÃ¥neder, der ikke mindst reagerer pÃ¥ Coronakrisen.

Siden slutningen af 1980â€™erne har Thierry Geoffroy / Colonel udviklet forskellige formater med det formÃ¥l at trÃ¦ne og udvikle, hvad han kalder for â€œThe Awareness Muscleâ€. Det vil sige evnen til at reagere og udtrykke sig i tide â€“ mÃ¥ske endda sÃ¥ tidligt, at man kan komme ulykker i forkÃ¸bet.

Hans mest kendte format er Emergency Room, et format som har involveret omkring 600 internationale kunstnere, der hver dag rekonstruerer prÃ¦sentationen og skaber en spritny udstilling, der forholder sig spÃ¸rgsmÃ¥let: â€œWhat is an emergency now?â€

Emergency Room har vÃ¦ret vist pÃ¥ museer som MoMA / PS1 og pÃ¥ institutioner i Athen, Napoli, Paris, Hanoi, Johanesburg, Berlin, Wrocalw osv.

Andre af kunstnerens â€˜nÃ¸dformaterâ€™ er: Critical Run, Biennalist, Debate rave, Slow dance debate m.fl. Se mere her

Geoffroy/Colonel har desuden arbejdet med et galleriformat, som han kalder for Gallery Ultracontemporaine, der undertiden tager form i andre gallerier, pÃ¥ kunstmesser, men ogsÃ¥ pÃ¥ internettet. Herunder kan du se et uddrag af hans egne ultrakontemporÃ¦re vÃ¦rker fra den sidste mÃ¥ned.",,24,0,0,0,PT57S,hd,public
