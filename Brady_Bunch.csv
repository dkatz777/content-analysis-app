CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Chenille (Kerry Washington) brings Sara (Julia Stiles) to a local club, where Nikki (Bianca Lawson) confronts them.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In this romantic drama, two teenagers in love struggle to look past their differences. After the unexpected death of her mother, Sarah Johnson (Julia Stiles) moves to Chicago to live with her father. Knowing no one at her new school and not at home in a gritty, inner-city high school, Sarah has trouble adjusting, but she soon becomes friends with Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), who has talent and street smarts but a checkered past. Sarah was an avid student of ballet before her mother's death sidelined her studies, while Derek has some serious hip-hop moves, and their mutual love of dance leads their friendship into something deeper. However, since Sarah is white and Derek is black, they have more to contend with than the average high school couple; Sarah gets static from Nikki (Bianca Lawson), Derek's former girlfriend, while Derek has to deal with his friend Malakai (Fredro Starr), who is still deep in the thug life Derek is trying to avoid. Save the Last Dance was directed by Thomas Carter, who previously examined the sociopolitical side of dancing in Swing Kids.

Behind the Scenes of the Brady Bunch Variety Hour,0etbqmXWTtU,Facts Verse,2020-07-10T16:00:01Z,"When most of us were all growing up, we all watched the Brady Bunch on the television. 

But did you know they made a spin-off series about the Brady family that everyone forgot? Not only that, but the story of how this series was made is also enough to write a book on it. If you1re a hard-core fan of the Brady clan, you'll need to watch this video to see what happened to the cast of the Brady Bunch Variety Hour to find out secrets that were never mentioned until recently. We've put together some amazing facts and stories about what this show was about and why it was so radically different than the original TV show. 

You'll also find out about the multiple problems that caused the cast and crew to face difficult times while it was filmed. See who they brought into the show and the kinds of characters that guest-starred. You'll have to watch the whole video until the end to find out who was crashing this show more often than not. While this show was short-lived when it first aired on TV in 1976, it might be a shocking reality when you learn what they did to make this show so different. You might be surprised to learn who helped keep the moral alive and pushed everyone to do their best. 

Even if you've never watched the Brady Bunch before, you might be surprised how the Brady Bunch Variety Hour might not be a bad show after all. Watch this informative behind the scenes look at TV history to get a better idea of what their real intentions might have been.

Thanks to Entertainment Tonight, USA Today and Good Morning America, we get a spectacular look inside with the Bradys and get their reactions to this incredible project. 

In 2018, HGTV paid 3.5 million dollars for the ""real"" Brady Bunch house located in Studio City, California. Day and night exteriors of the front of the house were used to match the fictional interiors on stage 5 at Paramount Studios in Hollywood.  

If you study the real exterior and the fake interior you'll notice that the 2nd story or split level do not match. That's not stopping HGTV, who says they plan to remodel the house in Studio City so that the interior, which looks nothing like it's fictional counterpart, matches the sets as close as possible. They are going to need a lot of wood paneling and burnt orange Formica!

The real excitement is that HGTV reunited all 6 Brady ""kids"" for their new show, A Very Brady Renovation. This latest Brady Bunch incarnation will premier in September 2019 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the original Brady Bunch show debut.
The big question is, who is going to live in the Brady Bunch House? I think we are going to see a 2nd series who's premise is to answer that very question.","The Brady Bunch House,The Brady Bunch,HGTV,A Very Brady Renovation",24,676687,7118,925,PT20M28S,hd,public

Whether it was Marcia or Greg, Bobby or Cindy, the on-screen siblings (and sometimes even their TV parents) were constantly hooking up, sometimes even during filming! It was well known to the other actors that Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen (Greg and Cindy Brady) used The Brady Bunch dogâ€™s kennel as their own personal love nest, nipping off between takes to hide inside and make out. 

The crew also had a hard time filming a seemingly innocent attic scene between Maureen McCormick (Marcia Brady) and Barry Williams (Greg Brady) because the two kept getting hot and heavy under the bedsheets. These two love birds also shared a kiss on the beach during the few episodes filmed in Hawaii. Off-set, Christopher Knight, who played Peter Brady, dated Eve Plumb (Jan Brady) for a while until they were caught doing the dirty by police in the back of Knightâ€™s pickup truck. The spark of romance fizzled after the fizz knocked on the window. 

The Brady Bunch dalliances werenâ€™t limited to the kids, either. Barry Williams, who played Greg Brady, had a massive crush on his TV mom, Florence Henderson (Carol Brady). In fact, the two of them even went out on a dinner date, despite the twenty-year age gap. Because Williams was only 16, his brother tagged along to chaperon the get-together. There were way more secretive liaisons on set, but youâ€™re going to have to watch the video to learn more about them! After you get to the end, be sure to like this video and share it with anyone else you know whoâ€™s a The Brady Bunch fan. And donâ€™t forget to subscribe to Facts Verse if you havenâ€™t already.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
With all of the Lost Boys dead, Max (Edward Herrmann) reveals himself as the head vampire and demands that Lucy (Dianne Wiest) join him.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In this hit '80s hybrid of the horror movie and the teen flick, a single mom and her two sons become involved with a pack of vampires when they move into an offbeat Northern California town. Lucy (Dianne Wiest) and her sons, Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim), move to Santa Carla to live with Lucy's lovable but curmudgeonly father (Barnard Hughes). Lucy gets a job from video-store owner Max (Edward Herrmann), then begins dating him, while Sam hangs out with Edward and Alan Frog (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), a pair of vampire-obsessed comic-shop clerks. Soon Michael falls in with some actual vampires after becoming enamored of one of their victims: Star (Jami Gertz), a gypsy-like vixen who is trying to hold on to her humanity even though vampire leader David (Kiefer Sutherland) wants to play Peter Pan to her Wendy. When Michael visits the cavernous hangout of David and his cronies and unwittingly drinks from a wine bottle full of vampiric blood, he becomes an unwilling member of the bloodsucker biker gang. Soon, it's up to Sam and the Frog brothers to destroy David and his ilk without killing Michael and Star. Shot on location in the coastal California town of Santa Cruz and directed by Hollywood pro Joel Schumacher, The Lost Boys became a pop-culture phenomenon thanks to its attractive young stars, offbeat soundtrack, and hip, clever marketing campaign. The film's tagline -- ""Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It's fun to be a vampire."" -- perfectly captured its knowing mixture of attitude and gore. The effects team who transformed Sutherland and company into snarling bloodsuckers would go on to provide equally gruesome effects for Blade, another revisionist vampire flick, more than a decade later.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Jealous Jan (Jennifer Elise Cox) dreams of cutting off Marsha's (Christine Taylor) hair, but it all backfires.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The Brady Bunch Movie pays tribute to the 1970s TV show while poking gentle fun at it. The Brady family, led by father Mike (Gary Cole), still live in their suburban, split-level home and are still throwbacks to the era that spawned them. Eternally perky wife Carol (Shelley Long) is the perfect homemaker, while the kids' behavior is as wholesome as their loud, time-warp pastel clothes. Meanwhile, the greedy, selfish modern era swirls dangerously around them, embodied in next-door neighbor and real estate agent Ditmeyer (Michael McKean), who wants to buy the Bradys' property and turn the neighborhood into a giant mall. But no amount of money or prodding can persuade the Bradys to give up their home. Director Betty Thomas contrasts the overlit sitcom look of the Brady house interiors (faithfully recreated from the series) with real locations and natural grit for the modern L.A. scenes. The result is a satire that deftly spoofs the idea of staying true to old-fashioned values without ever passing judgment on those values.

The Brady Bunch is an American sitcom created by Sherwood Schwartz and starring Robert Reed, Florence Henderson, and Ann B. Davis. The series revolved around a large blended family. 

The show originally aired from September 26, 1969 to March 8, 1974 on ABC and was subsequently syndicated internationally. Mike Brady (Robert Reed), a widowed architect; with three sons, Greg (Barry Williams), Peter (Christopher Knight), and Bobby (Mike Lookinland); marries Carol Ann Martin (nÃ©e Tyler) (Florence Henderson), who has three daughters: Marcia (Maureen McCormick), Jan (Eve Plumb) and Cindy (Susan Olsen). 

The wife and daughters take the Brady surname. Producer Schwartz wanted Carol to have been a divorcÃ©e but the network objected to this. A compromise was reached whereby no mention was made of the circumstances in which Carol's first marriage ended. Included in the blended family are Mike's live-in housekeeper, Alice Nelson (Ann B. Davis), and the boys' dog, Tiger. The setting is a large, suburban, two-story house designed by Mike, in a Los Angeles, California suburb.","The Brady Bunch (Award-Winning Work),family,tv series,Theme,Song,Opening,Title",24,464769,1368,131,PT1M42S,sd,public

Oh my I did not remember this theme song correctly, Because despite the image of the perfect suburban life that The Brady Bunch portrayed, behind the scenes, the cast was bonding, getting to know each other very well. Very, very well. And honestly, thatâ€™s exactly what youâ€™d expect when you take six hormonal kids and donâ€™t let them see anyone but themselves, their perfect parents and foxy housekeeper.

The ZOOM Song - Brady Bunch Parody
Zoom and other video conference apps have been a great way for co-workers, family, and friends to stay connected during social distancing. It's been a great way to stay in touch while we stay at home. However, these zoom calls are not without their own technical problems. So we thought we'd sing about them! 

The inspiration of this video came from a Zoom call when Brian found out that his nephew didn't know what the Brady Bunch, was he made a made a reference their conversation looking like the Brady Bunch while in gallery view, and thus a parody song was born. Wishing you and yours all the best ðŸ’™

Thanks to our amazing friends for recording and filming themselves from home to be a part of this video!

Delve into the early days as we trace the house's origins in 1959, built in the style of the times with its split-level design and signature A-frame exterior. Feel the nostalgia wash over you as the house makes its on-screen debut in 1969, introducing the world to the blended Brady family and their picture-perfect suburban home.

Marvel at rare behind-the-scenes glimpses of this Los Angeles landmark. Did you know the interiors were entirely fabricated on a Hollywood set? This video lifts the veil on the show's filming secrets and the disconnect between TV magic and reality.

Go behind the scenes of the extensive HGTV-led renovations that stunned fans. Through exclusive interviews and never-before-seen footage, discover how every interior detail was painstakingly recreated to mirror the original sets. You'll hear first-hand from the cast members themselves as they get emotional walking through the refurbished rooms.

Follow the twists and turns as the house goes up for sale twice, sparking feverish bidding wars. Find out how a former boyband star almost bought this slice of Americana before getting outbid. Learn the strategy behind the jaw-dropping $5.5 million purchase price, the most ever paid for a property on the show.

And get up close and personal with the current owner, superfan Tina Trahan, as she shares what convinced her to invest in this ""piece of her childhood."" You'll understand her poignant perspective on why the value of the house extends far beyond dollars. Part house tour, part pop culture retrospective, this video is a must-watch for Brady Bunch fans and TV nostalgia buffs.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Marsha (Christine Taylor) gets hit in the face with a football, ruining her life forever.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The Brady Bunch Movie pays tribute to the 1970s TV show while poking gentle fun at it. The Brady family, led by father Mike (Gary Cole), still live in their suburban, split-level home and are still throwbacks to the era that spawned them. Eternally perky wife Carol (Shelley Long) is the perfect homemaker, while the kids' behavior is as wholesome as their loud, time-warp pastel clothes. Meanwhile, the greedy, selfish modern era swirls dangerously around them, embodied in next-door neighbor and real estate agent Ditmeyer (Michael McKean), who wants to buy the Bradys' property and turn the neighborhood into a giant mall. But no amount of money or prodding can persuade the Bradys to give up their home. Director Betty Thomas contrasts the overlit sitcom look of the Brady house interiors (faithfully recreated from the series) with real locations and natural grit for the modern L.A. scenes. The result is a satire that deftly spoofs the idea of staying true to old-fashioned values without ever passing judgment on those values.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
The neighbors can't understand Cindy's (Olivia Hack) lisp and Dad (Gary Cole) gives Cindy advice about tattling.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The Brady Bunch Movie pays tribute to the 1970s TV show while poking gentle fun at it. The Brady family, led by father Mike (Gary Cole), still live in their suburban, split-level home and are still throwbacks to the era that spawned them. Eternally perky wife Carol (Shelley Long) is the perfect homemaker, while the kids' behavior is as wholesome as their loud, time-warp pastel clothes. Meanwhile, the greedy, selfish modern era swirls dangerously around them, embodied in next-door neighbor and real estate agent Ditmeyer (Michael McKean), who wants to buy the Bradys' property and turn the neighborhood into a giant mall. But no amount of money or prodding can persuade the Bradys to give up their home. Director Betty Thomas contrasts the overlit sitcom look of the Brady house interiors (faithfully recreated from the series) with real locations and natural grit for the modern L.A. scenes. The result is a satire that deftly spoofs the idea of staying true to old-fashioned values without ever passing judgment on those values.

""Hair-Brained Scheme"" (The Brady Bunch)
Aired: March 8, 1974
Written By: Charles Stewart

On the eve of Greg's (Barry Williams) graduation, Bobby (Mike Lookinland) embarks on a get-rich-quick scheme involving some shady hair tonic. Feeling bad, Greg buys a bottle... but freaks out when he discovers it has turned his hair orange! Meanwhile, Cindy (Susan Olson) and Cousin Oliver (Robbie Rist) embark on a money-making scheme of their own involving two bunny rabbits.

This episode is notable for the fact that it's the season (and series) finale, and yet Mike Brady (Robert Reed) was fired from the show during its production by creator Sherwood Schwartz and his producer son LLoyd Schwartz.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Mike Brady and his wife Carol Brady have just only one week to come up with $20,000 in back taxes or their house is sold and they'll have no choice but to move. And it's up to the Brady kids to secretly raise money and save the homestead before they lose their house to their scheming neighbor Mr. Larry Dittmeyer.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The Brady Bunch Movie pays tribute to the 1970s TV show while poking gentle fun at it. The Brady family, led by father Mike (Gary Cole), still live in their suburban, split-level home and are still throwbacks to the era that spawned them. Eternally perky wife Carol (Shelley Long) is the perfect homemaker, while the kids' behavior is as wholesome as their loud, time-warp pastel clothes. Meanwhile, the greedy, selfish modern era swirls dangerously around them, embodied in next-door neighbor and real estate agent Ditmeyer (Michael McKean), who wants to buy the Bradys' property and turn the neighborhood into a giant mall. But no amount of money or prodding can persuade the Bradys to give up their home. Director Betty Thomas contrasts the overlit sitcom look of the Brady house interiors (faithfully recreated from the series) with real locations and natural grit for the modern L.A. scenes. The result is a satire that deftly spoofs the idea of staying true to old-fashioned values without ever passing judgment on those values.

Did you know that Maureen McCormick and Eve Plumb didnâ€™t wear bras for several episodes of The Brady Bunch, or are you surprised to learn that any of the showâ€™s child stars would want to rebel against the successful seriesâ€™ innocent demeanor? The Brady Bunch came on the air in 1969 and became a massive hit with audiences almost instantly. The show followed the exploits of its titular family, made up of two widowed parents and their respective children from their previous marriages. Those children consisted of three boys and three girls. A different talented child star portrayed each of these children, with the eldest daughter being portrayed by actress Maureen McCormick.

Maureen McCormick came of age while filming The Brady Bunch, and this made her particularly poised to begin rebelling against the showâ€™s innocent demeanor over the course of its five-season run. Maureenâ€™s rebellion first took the form of her suggesting more mature storylines to the showâ€™s writer, a suggestion that they understandably turned down. After this, Maureen took the maturation of the show into her own hands by deciding not to wear a bra.

Maureen convinced Eve Plumb, who played middle Brady daughter Jan, to join her in her braless hijinks. They went through the filming of several episodes before the seriesâ€™ director took notice and promptly reprimanded them for the deed. These two stars werenâ€™t the only members of The Brady Bunch's cast to grow increasingly bored of the series, and its innocent demeanor by the show's end. Join Facts Verse as we explore why Maureen McCormick filmed these episodes of The Brady Bunch without a bra.","facts verse,facts verse presents",24,237380,2126,205,PT8M12S,hd,public

Olsen sets the record straight on the alleged affair between her on-screen brother, Barry Williams, and TV mom, Florence Henderson. She emphasizes the mutual respect and love that defined their relationship, dismissing any insinuations of a romantic affair. This revelation is supported by Lloyd Schwartz, son of the show's producer, who also debunks the long-standing rumor.
This video also delves into the personal struggles faced by the cast members, including Williams' experimentation with drugs and Maureen McCormick's battle with anxiety and substance abuse. Robert Reed, who portrayed the quintessential family man, Mike Brady, is revealed to have been privately grappling with his own identity, being gay in an era when societal norms were rigid and often unyielding.

The narrative further explores the off-screen dynamics of the young actors, who were not immune to the natural inquisitiveness and explorations that come with adolescence. Olsen shares anecdotes of innocent off-screen romances among the cast members, providing a fascinating contrast to the on-screen Brady family dynamics.

This video offers a compelling insight into the realities behind the facade of the idyllic family life depicted in ""The Brady Bunch."" It sheds light on the real-life tales that gave rise to the characters and attests to the show's ongoing power.

Do well to watch this video to the very end to discover facts and interesting secrets about ""The Brady Bunch"" you never knew.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Jan (Jennifer Elise Cox) is convinced to return home by a friendly truck driver (Ann B. Davis).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The Brady Bunch Movie pays tribute to the 1970s TV show while poking gentle fun at it. The Brady family, led by father Mike (Gary Cole), still live in their suburban, split-level home and are still throwbacks to the era that spawned them. Eternally perky wife Carol (Shelley Long) is the perfect homemaker, while the kids' behavior is as wholesome as their loud, time-warp pastel clothes. Meanwhile, the greedy, selfish modern era swirls dangerously around them, embodied in next-door neighbor and real estate agent Ditmeyer (Michael McKean), who wants to buy the Bradys' property and turn the neighborhood into a giant mall. But no amount of money or prodding can persuade the Bradys to give up their home. Director Betty Thomas contrasts the overlit sitcom look of the Brady house interiors (faithfully recreated from the series) with real locations and natural grit for the modern L.A. scenes. The result is a satire that deftly spoofs the idea of staying true to old-fashioned values without ever passing judgment on those values.

The Brady Bunch is an American sitcom created by Sherwood Schwartz that aired from September 26, 1969, to March 8, 1974, on ABC. The series revolves around a large blended family with six children. The show aired for five seasons and, after its cancellation in 1974, went into syndication in September 1975. Though it was never a ratings hit or a critical success during its original run, the program has since become a popular syndicated staple, especially among children and teenage viewers.

These elements made the family an aspirational ideal for many viewers. Despite being panned by criticsâ€”some going so far as to label it ""a crime""â€”and ending after five seasons and 117 episodes, the show found enduring popularity, particularly among after-school audiences. This timeless series continues to impart lessons and warm hearts across generations. Unfortunately, some original cast members have passed away and cannot witness the show's ongoing legacy.

8 Scandals the Brady Bunch Cast Tried to Cover Up,itG4aklRIFo,Facts Verse,2021-04-21T20:00:08Z,"The Brady Bunch is one of the most classic television shows in American history. As we all know, it follows the large blended family of the Bradies, which consists of parents Mike and Carol Brady, and their many children, Greg, Marcia, Peter, Jan, Bobby, and Cindy. The premise of such a large family inspired all sorts of shenanigans on screen, and was a perfect blend of wholesome and ridiculous.

The show was created by Sherwood Schwartz, who was also the genius behind the classic sitcom Gilliganâ€™s Island. The Brady Bunch first aired on September 26, 1969, and ran for five seasons until it eventually ended on March 8th, 1974. While it is considered a staple of classic American television today, and is extremely popular in syndication, it wasnâ€™t always so popular. In fact, during its original run, The Brady Bunch was outshone by shows like Hereâ€™s Lucy or Gunsmoke. It wasnâ€™t until it entered syndication that people really began to appreciate the show for what it was.

Today, people all over the country still enjoy watching reruns of The Brady Bunch, and itâ€™s even considered a cultural icon. The classic intro sequence and theme song is well known, even amongst children who werenâ€™t even dreamed of at the time the show aired.

After producers realized how popular The Brady Bunch became after it entered syndication, they decided to make more shows based around the same premise. It inspired a large number of spin-offs, including The Brady Brides, The Brady Bunch Hour, and even a few made for TV movies. Today, one of the reasons that The Brady Bunch has remained so popular is that it is widely considered to be the very last of the classic old-style sitcoms.

Many people imagine The Brady Bunch to be one of the most classic and wholesome television shows of the past. However, as youâ€™ll soon find out, there was a lot more going behind the scenes, and not all of it was as pure as what aired on television. In todayâ€™s video, weâ€™re going to take a look at eight dark scandals the cast of The Brady Bunch tried their hardest to cover up, because they knew it would ruin the reputation of the show. Make sure you stick around, because weâ€™re also going to reveal how one cast member had to hide his sexuality! We hope you like this video, and donâ€™t forget to subscribe to Facts Verse for more!

Why â€˜The Brady Bunchâ€™ Measles Episode Is Getting Grief,MNl1yNckUFQ,Inside Edition,2019-04-29T21:32:16Z,"An episode of ""The Brady Bunch"" is being shared online by people who do not agree with vaccinating against the measles. In the 1969 episode titled ""Is There a Doctor in the House?"", all six Brady children get the disease, but it doesnâ€™t seem to be a big deal. The episode shows the children sitting around, playing games and expressing relief that they don't need to take medicine or get shots. The episode is often cited by those who do not want to vaccinate their children. #InsideEdition","antivax,brady bunch,cat-health,health,ie offbeat,inside edition,inside_edition,marcia brady,measles,measles outbreak,medical advice,vaccines",25,136583,2350,585,PT2M17S,hd,public

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Mike (Gary Cole) summarizes a speech from Jan (Jennifer Elise) about family... and home... and family.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The Brady Bunch Movie pays tribute to the 1970s TV show while poking gentle fun at it. The Brady family, led by father Mike (Gary Cole), still live in their suburban, split-level home and are still throwbacks to the era that spawned them. Eternally perky wife Carol (Shelley Long) is the perfect homemaker, while the kids' behavior is as wholesome as their loud, time-warp pastel clothes. Meanwhile, the greedy, selfish modern era swirls dangerously around them, embodied in next-door neighbor and real estate agent Ditmeyer (Michael McKean), who wants to buy the Bradys' property and turn the neighborhood into a giant mall. But no amount of money or prodding can persuade the Bradys to give up their home. Director Betty Thomas contrasts the overlit sitcom look of the Brady house interiors (faithfully recreated from the series) with real locations and natural grit for the modern L.A. scenes. The result is a satire that deftly spoofs the idea of staying true to old-fashioned values without ever passing judgment on those values.

The Brady Bunch is an American sitcom created by Sherwood Schwartz that aired from September 26, 1969, to March 8, 1974, on ABC. The series revolves around a large blended family of six children, with three boys and three girls. After its cancellation in 1974, the series debuted in syndication in September 1975. Though it was never a ratings hit or a critical success during its original run, the program has since become a popular syndicated staple, especially among children and teenage viewers. 

The Brady Bunch's success in syndication led to several television reunion films and spin-off series: The Brady Bunch Hour (1976â€“77), The Brady Girls Get Married (1981), The Brady Brides (1981), A Very Brady Christmas (1988), and The Bradys (1990). In 1995, the series was adapted into a satirical comedy theatrical film titled The Brady Bunch Movie, followed by A Very Brady Sequel in 1996. A second sequel, The Brady Bunch in the White House, aired on Fox in November 2002 as a made-for-television film.

In 1997, ""Getting Davy Jones"" (season three, episode 12) was ranked number 37 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. The show's enduring popularity has resulted in its widespread recognition as an American cultural icon.

The house built in 1959, by Harry M. Londelius Jr., and used in exterior shots, is located in Studio City, within the city limits of Los Angeles. It originally bore little relation to the interior of the Bradys' on-screen home, but was gutted and renovated in 2018 to match the layout of the soundstage sets. According to a 1994 article in the Los Angeles Times, the San Fernando Valley house was built in 1959 and selected as the Brady residence because series creator Schwartz felt it looked like a home where an architect would live. A false window was attached to the front's A-frame section to give the illusion that it had two full stories (the 2018/19 renovation installed a real window where the false one was in the TV show footage). 

Contemporary establishing shots of the house were filmed with the owner's permission for the 1990 TV series The Bradys. The owner refused to allow Paramount to restore the property to its 1969 look for The Brady Bunch Movie in 1995, so a facade resembling the original home was built around an existing house.

The house was put up for sale, for the first time since 1973, in the summer of 2018 with an asking price of $1.885 million. Cable network HGTV outbid seven others for it, including NSYNC's Lance Bass.[23] HGTV has expanded the home for its original series A Very Brady Renovation, with the goal of recreating each of the interior rooms used in the TV series (which had only existed as a Paramount Studios set) while maintaining the original exterior look from the street, and to make it fully habitable (unlike the sets made on Paramount soundstage #5). The six actors who played the TV children, and who also actively participated in the 2018/19 renovation, posed for a photo in front on November 1 the same year. In May 2023, it was announced that HGTV was selling the house for $5.5 million. The house was bought on September 11, 2023 by media executive Tina Trahan, the wife of former HBO chief executive Chris Albrecht and a longtime fan of the show, for $3.2 million. She said she will leave the house as is and not renovate nor update it, and no one will be living in the house, and plans to use it for charity events and fundraisers.

In the series, the address of the house was given as 4222 Clinton Way (as read aloud by Carol from an arriving package in the first-season episode entitled ""Lost Locket, Found Locket"", and ""Clinton Way"" is clearly legible on Marcia's driver permit in the fifth-season episode ""The Driver's Seat""). Although no city was ever specified, it was presumed from references to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Los Angeles Rams, and a Hollywood film studio, among many others, that the Bradys lived in Southern California, most likely Los Angeles or one of its suburbs.","The Brady Bunch,The Brady Bunch house,A Very Brady Renovation,The Brady Bunch episodes,The Brady Bunch theme,The Brady Bunch house tour,The Brady Bunch intro,The Brady Bunch Marcia Marcia Marcia,Inside The Brady Bunch house,Filming locations,The Brady Bunch documentary",24,90868,4759,621,PT44M28S,hd,public

Perhaps the creators of the Brady Bunch shouldn't feel that bad about making a few minor continuity errors and revealing blunders throughout the production of their show. Things like that happen with every program. Some, a bit more than others. The Brady's certainly had their fair share.

If you were a child when you first watched The Brady Bunch, then you probably didn't notice any of these flubs. Now that you're all grown up, however, they probably stick out like a sore thumb. In this video, we're going to be discussing 13 things that you only noticed on The Brady Bunch as an adult. So, keep watching and get ready for a revealing journey down memory lane. Chances are, after watching this you'll never look at The Brady Bunch the same way ever again.

Scandalous Secrets You Never Knew About the Brady Bunch,8S5am-5zBiY,Facts Verse,2023-09-09T16:00:09Z,"""The Brady Bunch,"" a wholesome family sitcom that depicted the everyday adventures of a blended family of eight, became an iconic fixture in American television during its run from 1969 to 1974. While the show painted a picture-perfect image of family life, behind the scenes lay a tapestry of secrets and mini-scandals that contrasted starkly with the show's squeaky-clean image.

Barry Williams, who played the eldest son Greg Brady, once candidly admitted to having a crush on Florence Henderson, the actress who portrayed his on-screen mother. This crush culminated in a date, though both have clarified that their relationship remained platonic. Furthermore, Williams and Maureen McCormick, who played his on-screen sister Marcia, shared a few off-screen kisses, embodying the typical teenage experimentation and romance. Another surprising revelation was Susan Olsen's hair debacle. To maintain the vibrant blonde hue for her character Cindy, her hair was bleached so frequently that it began to break and fall out, leading to Olsen wearing wigs in later episodes. However, one of the most poignant behind-the-scenes stories was that of Robert Reed, who portrayed patriarch Mike Brady.

 Reed, a classically trained actor, frequently clashed with show creator Sherwood Schwartz over script quality, deeming some episodes unrealistic. Reed's personal life was also a subject of quiet speculation; he was gay but kept his sexuality hidden due to the societal prejudices of the time. He died in 1992, and it was later revealed that he had been HIV positive. While ""The Brady Bunch"" remains a beloved classic, the off-screen tales offer a nuanced and multifaceted view, showcasing the complexities of life behind the camera. In this video, weâ€™re taking a closer look at these stories, as well as some others, to get a better glimpse into the world of the Brady Bunch show, both on and off the set. So join us, as Facts Verse presents: Scandalous Secrets You Never Knew About the Brady Bunch.

Opening to The Brady Bunch Movie VHS (07-25-95) (USA),ayhWMdciDDM,Jesse Coffey,2018-11-16T00:04:51Z,"Printed during the 25th week of 1995. The original sitcom family of the early 1970s is placed in a then-contemporary environment and a culture clash ensues from there. The original Bradys (except Eve Plumb, and the by-that-point deceased Robert Reed) make cameo appearances as the people the Bradys run into along the way. RuPaul, Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, and Peter Tork are also seen for a portion of this off-beat adaptation of the series, which ran from 1969-74 on ABC-TV.

NOTE: The tape is damaged at the beginning. But even it knows people did this opening a lot.

Maureen McCormick was best known for her role as Marcia Brady. While the character was popular, she often resented the fact that she couldnâ€™t branch out from the role. In later years, she managed to come to terms with the role.

Eve Plumb loved playing Jan Brady and happily discussed the character in many reunion documentaries. The same went for Susan Olsen who played Cindy Brady and managed to venture into radio after she finished work on the series.

The Brady Bunch cast also had the three boys, Greg, Peter, and Bobby. Barry Williams loved playing Bobby and has always had fond memories of the show. Christopher Knight loved playing Peter and managed to transition to a career in the tech industry. Mike Lookinland has moved on to primarily working behind the scenes in the film and TV industry.

Florence Henderson was a prolific actress though she became a star when she joined The Brady Bunch cast. She managed to continue acting regularly on TV following her role on The Brady Bunch and also worked occasionally in cinema

Robert Reed was a versatile actor who managed to move on from his role in The Brady Bunch as Mike Brady. It was one of his most popular roles but he still managed to secure roles in other popular TV shows and films. 

Ann B. Davis was perhaps best known for her iconic role as Alice in The Brady Bunch but continued to act in other TV shows throughout her career.

Cindy Brady Got Brady Bunch Reboot CANCELLED Over Trump Support?!,IcrYUBO0ItI,Clownfish TV,2024-10-25T04:23:51Z,"ðŸ  Become a MEMBER of The Reef at http://ClownfishMinus.com
CBS Studios allegedly canceled a planned Brady Bunch revival due to Susan Olsen's support of Donald Trump, views on COVID vaccines, and stance on LGBTQ+ issues.

The proposed Brady Bunch reboot aimed to be diverse and inclusive, featuring a trans child and a black spouse, which Olson criticized as ""fake and tokenistic"".

Olson was fired from a Los Angeles radio show in 2016 for ""hateful speech"", with her private messages revealing racist and homophobic views she calls her ""greatest hits"".

Actor Zachary Levi claims the entertainment industry suffers from ""entrenched bigotry"" against those not aligning with far-left views, resulting in severe social and professional consequences.

The Brady Bunch revival's attempt at diversity was deemed inauthentic by Olsen, who believed it would fail due to its forced representation.

Olson's controversial opinions and unapologetic stance on her views led to her exclusion from the potential Brady Bunch reboot project.

Cindy Brady's support for Trump and her controversial views are claimed to have contributed to the cancellation of a Brady Bunch reboot, highlighting Hollywood's hypocrisy regarding diversity and the marginalization of dissenting opinions.

00:00 Cindy Brady's actress claims her Trump support caused the Brady Bunch reboot's cancellation amid CBS's financial issues.

01:54 Hollywood's divisive celebrity rhetoric and hypocrisy in diversity efforts are harming their projects and marginalizing dissenters.

03:12 Cindy Brady's Trump support allegedly led to the cancellation of a Brady Bunch reboot, despite her success as a podcaster.

05:27 Cindy Brady attributes the cancellation of the Brady Bunch reboot to backlash over her political views, criticizing Hollywood's selective tolerance and double standards regarding differing opinions.

07:38 Cindy Brady's support for diversity in a Brady Bunch reboot and her controversial past led to its cancellation amid criticism of societal ignorance and regression.

10:17 Cindy Brady defends her controversial views amid backlash over her potential involvement in a reboot of The Brady Bunch.

11:35 Clifton Duncan discusses Zachary Levi's silence on controversy and the blacklisting of a theater figure for non-conformist views, exposing hypocrisy in the industry's inclusivity.

13:13 Many in Hollywood fear backlash for non-leftist views, leading to frustration over politically driven content and a decline in the industry.

The Brady Bunch - Episode 511 - The Cincinnati Kids - Act 1 (Letterbox),fNcCeJ6onZU,Classic TV & More,2019-11-07T23:00:08Z,"It can only mean one thing when Mike Brady has a big surprise. Yep, a fantastic family vacation. Brady style. Alice is included of course.

So, where did the Brady Bunch vacation in their 5th and final season? Cincinnati of course! Since Mike Brady was working on a design for Kings Island amusement park, his firm thought it would be a swell idea to send his whole family along with him at company expense. We should all work for such a generous company!

Was anyone watching this at the park on any of the days the show was filming? If so, please share your memories.

Watching the crowds in this show is always interesting to me. Obviously, the park was operating while filming took place. Looking at the people in the background it appears they were roped off. And they are watching the Brady's!!! Not good. How to fix? Offer those in the park the opportunity to be extras. Not sure if they got paid. Not sure if they were selected in the park. These first time actors were directed to create cross traffic in front and behind of the Bradys to help camouflage the staring crowds. The funny thing is, whatever the direction they were given, they look like the most unhappy and bored people. No excitement, no smiles, no laughter. 

Fun fact: According to Susan Olsen, a three episode trip to India was scripted, but Paramount Television, who was always looking to save money, decided to produce the Kings Island show instead. 

Technical note: The Brady Bunch was filmed for television's 4:3 aspect ratio. MeTV broadcasts in today's modern 16:9 aspect ratio. I have not figured out what TV stations like MeTV, who are broadcasting 4:3 shows in a 16:9 space are doing. Although the aspect ratio is wider than 4:3, it still does not fill the 16:9 raster. Do they blow up or stretch the picture? One clue may be in the main title. The nine squares have been changed to 3 squares and 6 rectangles.","The Brady Bunch Episode 511,The Brady Bunch,Episode 511,The Cincinnati Kids,Kings Island",24,35371,206,0,PT2M23S,sd,public

Wir erzÃ¤hlen euch Geschichten
vonâ€š ner hÃ¼bschen Dame, die drei TÃ¶chter hat,
frÃ¶hlich warâ€˜n sie alle zwar, doch ohne Vati
und des Alleinseins satt.

Doch dann traf sie Mr. Brady,
seine Jungen waren leider auch allein,
eine Mami fehlte ihnen zum wirklich glÃ¼cklich sein.

Jetzt sind alle eine frÃ¶hliche Familie,
erst vereint da fÃ¼hlen sie sich richtig groÃŸ.

Bei drei Jungs und bei drei netten MÃ¤dchen,
da ist jeden Tag natÃ¼rlich etwas los.
Da ist was los, da ist was los,
bei den Bradys ist was los, da ist was los.","Drei MÃ¤dchen und drei Jungen,The Brady Bunch,ZDF,Mike Brady,Greg,Peter,Bobby,Carol Ann Tyler Martin,Marcia,Jan,Cindy Hund Tiger,HaushÃ¤lterin Alice,Abbe Lane,Ann B.

Its enduring popularity led to numerous spin-offs, reunion specials, and even feature films, solidifying its status as a cultural phenomenon. However, despite its widespread acclaim, ""The Brady Bunch"" faced challenges towards the end of its run. The series was cancelled in 1974 after five seasons, abruptly ending the Brady family's on-screen adventures. The decision to cancel the show came as a surprise to many fans, who had grown accustomed to the Brady's weekly antics. The final episode, titled ""The Hair-Brained Scheme,"" aired without one of its central characters, Mike Brady, played by Robert Reed. Reed's absence from the finale raised eyebrows and speculation among fans, with many wondering about the reasons behind his departure.

Despite its premature end, ""The Brady Bunch"" left an indelible legacy, influencing countless television shows and pop culture references in the decades that followed. Its wholesome portrayal of family life, timeless humor, and memorable characters continue to resonate with audiences today, making it a perennial favorite in the annals of television history. While the Brady family's on-screen journey may have come to an end, their legacy lives on in the hearts and minds of fans who fondly remember their adventures and mishaps in the iconic Brady household. Robert Reed's absence in the finale has been the subject of speculation and curiosity among fans for years, prompting inquiries into the behind-the-scenes dynamics and personal reasons that may have influenced his decision not to appear.

During the final season of The Brady Bunch, Sherwood Schwartz and company attempted to freshen up the series by introducing a new character.

Actor Robbie Rist was cast to play Cousin Oliver. While he only ever appeared in six episodes, Rist's brief stint on the series was pretty memorable. Unfortunately, memorable in this case wasn't a very positive thing. Cousin Oliver wasn't seen as a very welcome addition to the cast. In fact, fans of the series almost universally loathed the character as soon as he made his appearance â€“ and while Cousin Oliver wasn't solely responsible for the show's cancellation, he certainly didn't help.

After The Brady Bunch wrapped up in 1974, Rist kept his acting career going appearing in live-action shows like NBC's Big John, Little John, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and Whiz Kids. In fact, he's still active today, most recently appearing in the 2013 campy horror film Sharknado as Robbie the Bus Driver.

While he has yet to retire from acting, the 58-year-old has found the most successful Post-Brady voice acting in cartoons, anime dubs, and video games. Some of his most significant credits in this realm include voice roles in offerings like Batman: The Animated Series, Sonic Boom, Naruto, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Final Fantasy X.

Rist is also a gifted and talented multi-instrumentalist and producer. We'll let you know what some of his most significant musical contributions are towards the end of this video, so don't go anywhere.

Subscribe for More! 

In today's pop culture, The Brady Bunch has risen to an almost celestial level of importance. It's now the quintessential 70s sitcom, and has been mentioned amongst the greatest sitcoms of all time. 

However, if the show was so era-defining and great, why did it last for only five seasons? 

After all, a lot of sitcoms that existed during that era went on for far longer. If The Brady Bunch was so good, why was it short lived? 

The answer to that question isn't so straightforward, and even the showrunners would have found it difficult to give a straight answer about why The Brady Bunch was cancelled. 

But the fact that the question doesn't have a straightforward answer doesn't mean it doesn't have an answer. 

And in this video, we'll be exploring the sitcom together and will be finding out why it only lasted for five years when it had the potential to last for even longer. 

First off, what was The Brady Bunch, and what made it such a great sitcom? Why did it capture the imagination of its viewers in the 70s, and why does it continue to capture our imagination even today?

Itâ€™s awkward, slightly stressful, and oddly and uncomfortably horny. These are real-world Brady kids dealing with some real world problems, they are all grown up but still lie to their parents and find themselves in some major pickles. Itâ€™s the late 80s and they got regrettable mustaches, godawful hairdos, annoying husbands and detestable children, but donâ€™t worry, some things donâ€™t changeâ€¦ Alice is still wearing her dowdy blue maid outfit. She only has one. And for no reason at all, Jeff also tells Chip about The Rizzler.
