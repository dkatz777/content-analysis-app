Rapper DMX Says Satan Approached Him 3 Times on Dr. Phil Show!!! MUST WATCH!!,y3sycx3zJ0c,Clayton Traylor,2013-10-20T06:13:35Z,"Please check out my Book ""Shining The Light, Exposing The Truth"" at http://www.shining-the-light.com exposing the Illuminati in the Music Industry, The New World Order, The Financial Institutions Corruption such as the World Bank and Federal Reserve, as well as Corrupt Politicians around the Globe in the pocket of the Illuminati...

It has been prophesied, over and over in the Bible. They will masquerade through this world as beacons of enlightenment, promising freedom and self-fulfillment to all who would listen to their message. Some are willing messengers of their Master's will, while others are unwitting victims themselves, fooled into believing that peace and prosperity can only come by uniting the world under one government.


It sounds so peaceful and loving. Governments and religions are coming together for the goal of bettering humanity. Humanitarian efforts are seemingly underway, under the guise of helping the poorest among us. It's no wonder that some of the kindest of us can fall prey to these lies. Some even turn to New Age religions in hopes of finding joy and harmony in the world. You've heard the propaganda at every level. From the brainwashing of our children, to the most popular entertainers of our time, even our Presidents have been known to serve the goals of the New World Order.


Unfortunately, the best among us can be deceived if we don't take a closer look. In this book, you will learn more about the Luciferian agenda. There are those amongst us who are actually serving a much darker power, while purporting to be messengers of light and hope. You will learn of some of the movements that have been shaping world politics and economics, and shifts in world religious thought. The influence of powerful occultists and dynasties of families can be traced back to very frightening origins.","dmx,satanism in music industry,new world order,illuminati,satanic rap music,demonic rap music",25,6185759,119334,15710,PT12M18S,sd,public

Danielle Bregoli, AKA Bhad Bhabie, appeared on Dr Phil when she was just 13. Her appearance spawned the iconic phrase â€œCatch me outside!â€ and ended with her being sent to the Turn-About Ranch for â€œtroubled teens.â€

Fame and fortune followed, but her experiences would haunt her, including a MURDER that took place during her time thereâ€¦ Sheâ€™d eventually help uncover a culture of abuse and exploitation at these facilities, that affected thousands of young women over many decades, including Paris Hilton and Kathleen Kubler, director of Netflixâ€™s: *The Program: Cons, Cults and Kidnapping.

Dr. Phil Meets with Schizophrenic 10-Year-Old | Dr. Phil,2G1quzPF8lI,Dr. Phil,2024-12-09T14:00:04Z,"Michael and Susan say when their daughter, Jani, was born, they immediately noticed that she wasnâ€™t like other children. They say as a newborn, Jani would sleep only three hours a day, and as she grew older, would see, hear and feel things that were not there. At 6 years old, Jani was diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia. Now 10, Jani, who has tested with a genius IQ, spends up to 95 percent of her days in an imaginary world she calls Calalini, where more than 100 people and animals reside. Michael and Susan say Janiâ€™s imaginary friends bring her comfort but also encourage her to act out, often in violent and destructive ways. While medication regulates her explosive tendencies, Michael and Susan say they fear for her future. They share a candid look inside their life, including the toll schizophrenia has taken on their marriage. Plus, find out why they fear their second child, Bodhi, whom they say they had as a companion for Jani, may be showing signs of the illness. And, Dr. Phil spends the day with Jani. Learn what he uncovers about her secret world. Then, Ashley, 25, was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a child and says sheâ€™s now replaced her medication with dangerous street drugs. Can Dr. Phil get her on the road to recovery? (2311015)

Tom Homan: Trumpâ€™s New â€œBorder Czarâ€ | EP277 | The Dr. Phil Podcast,mALu3xPJ0uk,The Dr. Phil Podcast,2024-12-10T05:00:37Z,"Dr. Phil has an in-depth conversation with President-Elect Trumpâ€™s incoming â€œborder czar,â€ Tom Homan. Tom is about as tough as they come. With decades of experience, heâ€™s been tapped to oversee all U.S. borders â€“ including air and sea security â€“ and lead the charge on deporting undocumented immigrants. Itâ€™s a cornerstone of Trumpâ€™s immigration plan. But Homan is no stranger to controversy. You probably remember his role in the â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy. Heâ€™s not afraid of a fight, and he doesnâ€™t back down when it comes to his beliefs. Tom tells Dr. Phil about his plans on day 1, how he will implement these mass deportations, and why heâ€™s so passionate about keeping our country safe from the cartels, drugs and human trafficking.

Then, by her early 20s, she was married three times and had three children with different dads. Their mother, Linda, says thatâ€™s when Amy started to change.

TELL DR. PHIL YOUR STORY: Hopelessly in need of Dr. Phil's Help?
 
â€œAfter her third child was born, Amy became very distant,â€ Linda says.
 
Tara says that in 2006, Amy started acting strange. â€œShe started calling herself â€˜Mother God,â€™ and she believed that she was God,â€ Tara says. â€œShe claims that she is Jesus, Marilyn Monroe, Cleopatra, and different people in the past.â€

WATCH: How Does A Woman Who Claims To Be God Explain Putting Child In Closet For 4 Minutes?
 
â€œMy sister is running a cult with a bunch of followers in Hawaii,â€ Chelsea claims, of the group Amy says is called Love Has Won. â€œShe believes that she has been sent to save the world. All of Amyâ€™s followers refer to her as Mom or Mama. I believe that Amy is scamming all of her followers.â€
 
In the video above from a Dr. Phil exclusive airing Monday, hear some of the other claims the sisters say Amy makes. On Monday, Amy speaks out. And on Tuesday, meet the family of a follower who claims he was left for dead by Love Has Won; an accusation which the group contends is false. Check here to see where you can watch.

Stories From The Border: Tom Homan | Incoming Border Czar | Ep. 278 | Dr. Phil Podcast,YRwXzcbvOQQ,The Dr. Phil Podcast,2024-12-10T17:00:35Z,"Dr. Phil continues his conversation with Tom Homan, the newly appointed border czar under President Trump, about his extensive experience in law enforcement and immigration enforcement over three decades. They dive into the political motivations behind border policies, the operational control of cartels, and the multifaceted challenges to border security, including terrorism risks and the humanitarian plight of migrants. Homanâ€™s perspectivesâ€”to many, controversialâ€”connect deeply with his long-standing commitment to enforcing immigration laws, as well as his emotional investments in preventing human suffering. The discussion captures a complex narrative of national security, politics, and humanitarian ethics, contributing to ongoing debates around U.S. border policy and enforcement. Dr. Phil supports Homanâ€™s dedication, applauding his transparency and the humanitarian concern for those affected by illegal border crossings. Throughout, the emphasis remains on securing borders to protect American citizens and migrants from harm. Whether you agree with his methods or not, there's no denying that Tom is a key player in the ongoing debate over border security.

Did She Marry an Imposter? | FULL EPISODE | Dr. Phil,Z0DcBwkGEPU,Dr. Phil,2024-12-08T20:00:06Z,"After a whirlwind four-month romance last year, Sheri married her soon-to-be ex, Tim. She claims he told her he was a retired doctor, former professional hockey player, wealthy businessman and Canadian air force pilot. But one month after the wedding, Sheri says she grew suspicious that Tim was cheating -- and soon unraveled what she calls a web of lies. She claims she learned from a news story that Tim had previously operated a pain management clinic in Texas -- without a medical license and under a different name -- and spent one year in prison for stealing nearly $30,000 from the parent company that owned the clinic. How could she not have known about Timâ€™s past? In a â€˜Dr. Philâ€™ exclusive, Tim -- via satellite -- shares his side of the story for the first time, in an effort to clear his name. Why does he say the allegations are bogus? And, why is he unable to travel to Los Angeles for the show? Then, Timâ€™s former fiancÃ©e -- who claims she, too, was deceived by him -- makes a shocking revelation about her ex. Plus, what did the â€˜Dr. Philâ€™ staff find when they investigated Timâ€™s history? How will he react to the findings? (From Dr. Phil Season 12)

This Woman Provides An Update After Her Ex-Husband Was Convicted Of Killing Their Son,ESyAGpEJmnM,Dr. Phil,2022-04-19T13:00:34Z,"Dr. Phil updates two crime stories. After 13-year-old Dylan Redwine disappeared in November 2012, his divorced parents, Elaine and Mark, and older brother, Cory, appeared on Dr.Phil trying to find answers. Almost 10 years later, Dylanâ€™s father, Mark Redwine - who sat on the stage and denied knowing anything about his sonâ€™s whereabouts â€“ was convicted of killing Dylan. Elaine and Cory update Dr. Phil on the details of the case since Mark was found guilty last fall and sentenced to 48 years in prison. Dr. Phil discusses how they can finally move on with their lives now that they have sought justice for Dylan. Then, hear from Cheryl, who appeared on Dr. Phil eight years ago, to find out what happened to her two grandchildren, 4-year-old Keira and 18-month-old Darby, who died just three months apart. She said she thought it was very suspicious and wanted answers. Today, Cheryl is still fighting for justice and says she will always be looking for the truth. Dr. Phil, as well as Elaine and Cory, offer words of encouragement and support. (20121)

Ted admits his relationship with Shannon was strained at the time, but he vehemently denies he had anything to do with her death. How will Ted react to Pennyâ€™s accusation? Tune in to watch the drama unfold as this father and daughter angrily level charges against each other -- can Penny and Ted find a way to repair their relationship, or have the accusations gone too far?

Uldouz Wallace On The Dr. Phil Show,mdAxUkbToHs,Uldouz Wallace,2023-01-04T23:03:46Z,"Hi guys! I recently went on The Dr. Phil show, to share my story about being a victim of the iCloud hack/leak & how it destroyed my life & how I also created a bill with NCOSE called The Protect Act to protect the future generations of women, men & children from online exploitation. 

This bill will protect everyone, technology is updating everyday but the lawâ€™s havenâ€™t changed. We need better laws. 

I have also created my own registered 501(c)3 non profit which is called Foundation Ra & Protect Americas Daughters (includes men & boys) to better help victims of Image Based Sexual Abuse, feel free to donate and get involved.

#wokeculture #candaceowensppdcast #drphil 
In this heated episode of Dr. Phil, conservative commentator Candace Owens clashes with a ""woke"" professor and other guests over the controversial topics of race, affirmative action, and social justice. Owens argues that race-based policies like affirmative action harm the very people they intend to help, promoting division and reverse discrimination rather than unity and fairness. The debate explores whether success should be measured by merit or race, with Owens and her supporters emphasizing hard work, discipline, and personal responsibility as the true keys to success. The discussion expands to a broader critique of ""woke"" ideologies, questioning the impact of race-focused policies in education and society.

With great courage and in open defiance of her sadistic abusers, Jenny wishes her story told. The ending will shock you.

Referring to journals written throughout childhood, Jenny Hill and her multiple personalities document how as a five year-old, she overcomes trauma by turning to prayer while utilizing her alter states to compartmentalize abuse at the hands of a master mind-control programmer from Nazi Germany. After suffering deaths of a high school sweetheart, plus her only girlfriend, she somehow completes Army medic training, receives a nursing degree, prepares for a church mission and becomes a mother.

Simultaneously led by sex-addict Head Alter J.J., intrepid alters assume frequent control, engaging in larceny and prostitution. With her children, her lifeline, the increasingly desperate nurse escapes a drugged-out pimping husband, blacks out in a job interview, comes to nine days later as an inpatient headed for the Utah State Psychiatric Hospital and only then learns what her life has really been.

Dr. Phil teams up for the first time with bestselling author, heart surgeon, and Emmy Award-winning host of The Doctor Oz Show, Dr. Mehmet Oz, to take on and fight internet fraudsters who have stolen their names and likenesses to endorse CBD products. Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz work to get the word out that they have never endorsed or sold any CBD products. Both doctors talk with Dr. Salimpour Pedram at a Los Angeles laboratory where some of the falsely marketed products were tested â€“ what did those tests reveal? As part of their joint investigation, Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz also interview William Teller, an actor hired to pose as the owner of one CBD company â€“ and you wonâ€™t believe what they learn! Internet Scam Investigator Chris Durst discusses how she helped to locate William Teller. They also talk to two viewers who say they were scammed by fake endorsements ... and one of them wants to tell Dr. Phil why she blamed him! Retired FBI agent and Cybercrime Expert Scott Augenbaum offers advice to avoid scams and action tips for scam victims. Finally, meet Alex, who thought she got a new job but actually fell victim to an employment scam.

Both David and Marla say they are very concerned for his mental health. They claim that DJ is delusional and say their son believes heâ€™s engaged to Rihanna, works alongside the likes of Jay-Z, Drake and BeyoncÃ©, has amassed a fortune of $700 billion and is the most powerful person in the world, with Presidents Trump and Obama working for him. Marla and David claim DJ is violent and poses a serious danger not only to himself, but also to others. DJâ€™s sister Moniece, one of the cast members of VH1â€™sÂ Love & Hop Hip Hollywood, says her brother is at his most extreme place in terms of his emotions, and sheÂ claimsÂ that he is mentally ill and in denial. But, DJ claims he is misunderstood by his family and says there is nothing wrong with him. (2316046)

When husband and wife Deborah and Todd on Dr. Phil, Deborah admitted to embellishing the truth to get revenge on Todd, which landed him in jail for almost a year. At that time, Todd vowed to get even. A few days after the show, he got his wish, and what has happened since seems like a made-for-TV movie! In a strange twist of events, Deborah received a text message stating that Todd had died. But two weeks later, she received a phone call from him! Todd joins the show to explain his side of the story. Did he fake his own death, or was it all a big misunderstanding? When Dr. Phil drills down, will the truth finally come out? And, the couple didn't take Dr. Phil's advice after the previous show, but will they now? You won't believe the twists and turns in this story of revenge!

Meet 'Goose Wayne': The Superhero Among Us on Dr Phil Show,DsctEe1bZd8,Shot Bust,2024-03-11T00:45:00Z,"Kalan wrote into the show desperate for Dr. Philâ€™s help because she says her fiancÃ©, Giovanni, made a major shift in his life goals. Just two days after he asked Kalan to marry him, she says the army veteran made a very serious decision to change his identity. Kalan says he has now taken on the persona of a superhero and will only answer to â€œGoose Wayne Batman.â€ Kalan says he refuses to take off his mask or eye makeup and although sheâ€™s loved him since she was 14, this may be too much to handle. â€œGoose,â€ as he refers to himself, says he just wants to help and protect people, and being â€œGoose Wayneâ€ is a non-negotiable part of his life and also his full-time job. The two are engaged to be married, but Kalan says she doesnâ€™t want to be walking down the aisle with a masked man.

Matt Brasch trying to expose GangStalking on the Dr Phil Show,TmkI0qmYI1s,Truth Stranger Than Fiction Truth Seeker,2014-12-28T02:22:46Z,"Disappointed that Dr. Phil discounted Matt Brasch and did not take a look at what Jesse Ventura uncovered in Brain Invaders or at least do a search on organized gang stalkers and electronic harassment and torture . . . Why would Dr. Phil not know about frequencies and thought intrusion, behavior modification and the technologies and frequencies for mass mind control? To dismiss Matt's concerns and create the idea Matt is crazy indicates Dr. Phil is a gatekeeper . . . This form of attack is becoming common in society and the sooner WE understand stalking is real we will be prepared when this happens to us . . .

""GangStalking"" is an undercover subversive program which uses ""ELF"" (Extremely Low Frequencies) to control multiple stalkers to harass ""Targeted Individuals"" (TI's) in this country and in other countries around the world.


So you ask yourself why people would choose to Stalk people like Matt and especially if they don't know them...

Occasional prime time specials have aired on CBS. The program has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award every year since 2004.

The executive producers are Phil McGraw and showrunner Oprah Winfrey. It is a production of Peteski Productions and distributed by CBS Media Ventures. Harpo Productions co-produced the series until 2010, with Paramount Domestic Television and its successor, CBS Paramount Domestic Television, serving as secondary co-producers until 2007. It was originally distributed by King World Productions.

The program is recorded before a live studio audience in Stage 29 on the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood, California. It is recorded from August through to May with a break in December for the holiday season. On October 25, 2018, it was announced that Dr. Phil had been renewed for four additional seasons, taking the show to May 2023, or the end of its 21st season.

He Admits to Cheating on His Wife: â€˜I Betrayed Susanâ€™ | Dr. Phil,mygPCqBwO2o,Dr. Phil,2024-12-09T17:00:51Z,"Michael and Susan say when their daughter, Jani, was born, they immediately noticed that she wasnâ€™t like other children. They say as a newborn, Jani would sleep only three hours a day, and as she grew older, would see, hear and feel things that were not there. At 6 years old, Jani was diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia. Now 10, Jani, who has tested with a genius IQ, spends up to 95 percent of her days in an imaginary world she calls Calalini, where more than 100 people and animals reside. Michael and Susan say Janiâ€™s imaginary friends bring her comfort but also encourage her to act out, often in violent and destructive ways. While medication regulates her explosive tendencies, Michael and Susan say they fear for her future. They share a candid look inside their life, including the toll schizophrenia has taken on their marriage. Plus, find out why they fear their second child, Bodhi, whom they say they had as a companion for Jani, may be showing signs of the illness. And, Dr. Phil spends the day with Jani. Learn what he uncovers about her secret world. Then, Ashley, 25, was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a child and says sheâ€™s now replaced her medication with dangerous street drugs. Can Dr. Phil get her on the road to recovery? (2311015)

Brittany says her best friend of 19 years, Daina, was late for appointments, refused to help with planning and didn't approve of her husband-to-be, so she asked her to step down. Daina says she tried to be there for her friend, but felt like she was getting shut out. What went wrong? In her place, Brittany asked Daina's sister, Noelle, to fill the role. Despite fears that it would cause further strain to her relationship with her sister, Noelle accepted, and now theyâ€™re at odds. Are there deeper issues at play?

Dr. Aliabadi on The Dr. Phil Show: Coco's Story,YIxsA_VRJtQ,Dr. Thais Aliabadi,2022-04-01T17:24:02Z,"We first met Teresa when she was 34 weeks pregnant and had been dependent on heroin for years. Admitting that she had not been able to stop using during her pregnancy, Teresa says she didnâ€™t want to do any more damage to her unborn child than she already had. 

Psychiatrist and retired Medical Director for the Los Angeles County Department Of Child And Family Services, Dr. Charles Sophy warned Teresa that, because of her continued drug use, her baby will almost certainly experience withdrawals as well as experience probable cognitive or developmental delays. 

Coco was delivered via cesarean section four weeks later. â€œShe was extremely sick, withdrawing from heroin and meth,â€ says Dr. Aliabadi, who, not only agreed to deliver Teresaâ€™s baby but also agreed to foster her. Watch Cocoâ€™s story now!

Brian is pastor of Chapel of Change, one of the fastest growing churches in the nation, based in Long Beach CA. He is the author of Young Man Arise! and host of Fresh Hope Radio on 99.5 KKLA. Brian was sucked into the gang violence of Los Angeles in the late 80s. He was arrested at 16 and subsequently sentenced to life in prison. At age 17 he experienced radical redemption and 16 years later miraculously released from prison to impact the world with the Gospel.

The Dr. Phil Show - Update on Baby Coco and The Aliabadi Family,GVsTn6y6vDY,Dr. Thais Aliabadi,2022-03-22T19:29:38Z,"When Teresa first appeared on Dr. Phil, she was homeless, dependent on heroin, and a few weeks away from giving birth. Admitting that she had not been able to stop using during her pregnancy, Teresa said that she didnâ€™t want to do any more damage to her unborn child than she already had. Advising Teresa that â€œQuitting cold-turkey is not an option right now,â€ because it would be too risky for both her and her unborn child, OB-GYN Dr. ThaÃ¯s Aliabadi offered to help Teresa through the final weeks of her pregnancy with specialized treatment and prenatal care. 

Baby Coco was delivered via cesarean section four weeks later. â€œShe was extremely sick, withdrawing from heroin and meth,â€ says Dr. Aliabadi, who, in addition to delivering Coco, became a foster mother to the infant. â€œWith a lot of love, and with the help of tons of doctors â€“ we have been able to completely heal her.â€ Find out how Coco is ding now!

On both shows McGraw offers advice in the form of ""life strategies"" from his life experience as a clinical and forensic psychologist.[3] The show is in syndication throughout the United States and a number of other countries. Occasional prime time specials have aired on CBS. The program has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award every year since 2004.

The executive producers are Phil McGraw and showrunner Oprah Winfrey. It is a production of Peteski Productions and distributed by CBS Media Ventures. Harpo Productions co-produced the series until 2010, with Paramount Domestic Television and its successor, CBS Paramount Domestic Television, serving as secondary co-producers until 2007. It was originally distributed by King World Productions.

The program is recorded before a live studio audience in Stage 29 on the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood, California. It is recorded from August through to May with a break in December for the holiday season. On October 25, 2018, it was announced that Dr. Phil had been renewed for four additional seasons, taking the show to May 2023, or the end of its 21st season.

____________

As the Anabolic Doc, since 2003, Iâ€™ve provided men who are using or have used anabolic steroids a confidential, ethical and professional medical venue to discuss their use. I do NOT in any way support  the use of any performance enhancing drugs - PEDs, anabolic steroid or other medicine for muscle building or body transformation. The â€œoff-labelâ€ use of PEDs, as such agents is considered illicit and may lead to adverse health outcomes. Please consult an expert health professional regarding any medical agent and do NOT use any medicine without the explicit advice and supervision of an appropriate medical expert. 

This video is for education and information only. This is not medical advice. Only take medications as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take illegal substances. Taking steroids can lead to serious health consequences.

Occasional prime time specials have aired on CBS. The program has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award every year since 2004.

The executive producers are Phil McGraw and showrunner Oprah Winfrey. It is a production of Peteski Productions and distributed by CBS Media Ventures. Harpo Productions co-produced the series until 2010, with Paramount Domestic Television and its successor, CBS Paramount Domestic Television, serving as secondary co-producers until 2007. It was originally distributed by King World Productions.

The program is recorded before a live studio audience in Stage 29 on the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood, California. It is recorded from August through to May with a break in December for the holiday season.
