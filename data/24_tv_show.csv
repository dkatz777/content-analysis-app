The clock ticks again with 24: LEGACY, the next evolution of the Emmy Award-winning â€œ24.â€ From Emmy Award-winning executive producer Howard Gordon (â€œHomeland,â€ â€œ24: Live Another Dayâ€), Academy Award- and Emmy Award-winning executive producer Brian Grazer (â€œA Beautiful Mind,â€ â€œ24â€), writers and executive producers Manny Coto and Evan Katz (â€œ24,â€ â€œ24: Live Another Dayâ€), director and executive producer Stephen Hopkins (â€œ24â€) and executive producer and original series star Kiefer Sutherland, 24: LEGACY chronicles an adrenaline-fueled race against the clock to stop a devastating terrorist attack on United States soil â€“ in the same real-time format that has propelled this genre-defining series. 

Six months ago in Yemen, an elite squad of U.S. Army Rangers, led by Sergeant ERIC CARTER (Corey Hawkins, â€œStraight Outta Comptonâ€), killed terrorist leader Sheik Ibrahim Bin-Khalid. In the aftermath, Bin-Khalidâ€™s followers declared a fatwah against Carter, his squad and their families, forcing them into federal witness protection. But a recent attempt on Carterâ€™s own life makes it clear to him that his team is now exposed. To thwart further attacks, Carter enlists REBECCA INGRAM (Miranda Otto, â€œHomelandâ€), who quarterbacked the raid that killed Bin-Khalid. Sheâ€™s a brilliant and ambitious intelligence officer who has stepped down from her post as National Director of CTU to support her husband, SENATOR JOHN DONOVAN (Emmy and Golden Globe Award winner Jimmy Smits, â€œNYPD Blue,â€ â€œThe West Wingâ€), in his campaign for President of the United States. Decades of sleepless nights and missed anniversaries landed her at the top. With the White House within their grasp, can she truly embrace a new role as First Lady? Or will her love of the action draw her back in? Together, in this fast-paced thrill ride, Carter and Ingram uncover a sophisticated terrorist network that will force them to ask: â€œWho can we trust?â€ As they battle Bin-Khalidâ€™s devotees, they are forced to confront their own identities, families and pasts.

Itâ€™s intense, fast-paced, action packed, and youâ€™ll want to keep watching. The show ran for 9 seasons and also includes a television film, 24: Redemption that bridges the sixth and seventh seasons. In 2017 24 was revived with a 12-episode spinoff, 24:Legacy.

Russian Trade - 24 Live Another Day - Final Scene,9iYA5Hve_8U,John Gormley - 24 Mega Fan,2016-08-17T16:39:04Z,"Here are Jack Bauer's final moments, in 24 Live Another Day. Sets up a strange story line giving the possibility of we might get to see Bauer again perhaps in Legacy. The writers couldn't bring themselves to kill off Jack Bauer, resulting in this conflicted ending for LAD. 

Here Chloe & Jack are trading their places with the Russians. In the same episode as Audrey's death. From seeing the promos for this episode and seeing the casket. I was certain it would be Jack with the death ending. Given the time jump. But the UK promo was released which stumped me as it showed a second from this scene with Jack and Chloe meeting, in daylight. So if the time jump occurred and he was still alive it twisted my mind for this.

Chloe receives a piece of paper off Jack, presumably with a note on it. Which she takes back and is an excellent set up for the future of 24. Always great to see Belcheck as well.

Best Quotes!

""If anything happens to her, or my family. Your entire world will come apart""

""We just want you Mr Bauer, that's all we ever wanted""

Jack Bauer & President Palmer's Final Conversation - 24 Season 4 Finale,Os-sKyfHRi8,John Gormley - 24 Mega Fan,2016-01-02T23:51:38Z,"After the 'bromance' showcased in the first 4 series of the show it has come to the point in the Season 4 Finale in which it shows us the last ever scene between Jack Bauer and President David Palmer. However this was unknown to the viewer at the time. Palmer mentions this could be the last time they ever speak. Jack then delivers his final lines to Palmer ''Mr President, its been an honor''. Marking a close to the season and Jack walks out into the sunset as Season 4 concludes. 

This scene has some relevance now as Kiefer Sutherland recently got cast as the President of a new drama series on ABC called 'Designated Survivor', I will be uploading clips from that show too once it begins airing. Also expect clips from other shows containing 24 Cast members to come on this channel.

Edgar Stiles Death - 24 Season 5,VeiUOiIzk8k,John Gormley - 24 Mega Fan,2016-01-03T22:14:18Z,"Here is another heart wrenching scene. This time it is the lovable Edgar Stiles who bites the bullet. After CTU is under attack in mid-season 5 from nerve gasses. Jack and the other main characters hide out in the situation room, which is sealed up avoiding any of the gasses to enter. However at this time Edgar was sent off to check up on Carrie. By the time he got back it was too late, he had already been effected by the nerve gas. His final word is ''Chloe'', as he stares at her through the glass. These two characters had a lot of tension between them in both Season 4 & 5. This shortly disappeared in this scene, where you can see how Chloe cares for Edgar. Edgar also receives the fifth silent clock in the series.

The TV Masterpiece That Disappeared (And Needs to Return),QOfG8sn709Y,Motion In Art,2024-06-07T16:46:18Z,"24 was one of the most revolutionary action series in television history. This video is both a love letter and a call to action â€” a plea to bring back the show that defined real-time storytelling.

While there have been a lot of shows and movies rebooted over the years, but there remains one series in particular that has, sadly, never been brought back to life, and that is 24. Hands down, one of the most action-packed television dramas of the 21st century. It truly pains me to see a show like 24 just disappear from almost all mainstream relevance. 

This is my video on why it should come back.

What is 24?

Each season covers 24 consecutive hours in Bauer's life using the real time method of narration, which is emphasized by the display of split screens and a digital clock. The show premiered on November 6, 2001, and spanned 204 episodes over nine seasons, with the series finale broadcast on July 14, 2014. In addition, the television film 24: Redemption aired between seasons six and seven, on November 23, 2008. 24 is a joint production by Imagine Television and 20th Century Fox Television.

After 2 years in a Chinese prison being relentlessly tortured on a day in day out basis by Cheng Zhi and his operatives, the US government once again proves how full of shit they truly are and that contrary to popular belief, they most certainly do negotiate with terrorists.  They negotiated with the Chinese government to have him released from prison just to sell him out and hand him over to some terrorists in hopes that they'll stop instigating suicide attacks across the USA AND give up one of their own in return for Jack, but only if they give him to them to murder him for revenge over an incident that happened years prior in Beirut Lebanon.  

It couldn't possibly get more disgusting than this, but this is where we are today.  Prove me wrong/Change my mind.

The central character is Jack Bauer, a former Delta Force operator who is the Director of the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) in Los Angeles.

24: Live Another Day Synopsis
Live Another Day takes place four years after the events of season 8. James Heller, now President, is negotiating a treaty in London, where a hacker collective preaching freedom of information has enlisted the help of Chloe O'Brian. Jack Bauer, who has been tracking the activities of Chloe's group while living in exile, resurfaces when he hears of an imminent attempt on Heller's life.

24 Legacy
After leading a mission to eliminate terrorist leader Sheikh Ibrahim bin-Khalid, Eric Carter (Corey Hawkins) returns to the U.S. and finds out that he and his squad mates are targeted for assassination in retaliation for bin-Khalid's supposed death. With nowhere else to turn, Carter asks CTU to help him save his life while also stopping one of the largest-scale terror attacks on American soil. The series takes place three years after the events of 24: Live Another Day and is set in Washington, D.C.
