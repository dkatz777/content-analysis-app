The Amazing Race Theme - All Three Versions,FGQsJC7Y4J8,Allen Douangchak,UC4YjEKVnKXU-4Gn2h6sC4vg,2016-10-08T13:17:54Z,"All three versions of The Amazing Race theme song!

The Amazing Race is an American reality competition show in which typically eleven teams of two race around the world. The race is generally split into twelve legs, with each leg requiring teams to deduce clues, navigate themselves in foreign areas, interact with locals, perform physical and mental challenges, and vie for airplane, boat, taxi, and other public transportation options on a limited budget provided by the show. Teams are progressively eliminated at the end of most legs, while the first team to arrive at the end of the final leg wins the grand prize of US$1 million. As the original version of the Amazing Race franchise, the CBS program has been running since 2001. The series concluded airing its 28th season on May 13, 2016 and has been renewed for at least one more season in 2016–17. The 29th season is scheduled to premiere mid-season during the 2016–17 television season. Numerous international versions have been developed following the same core structure, while the U.S. version is also broadcast to several other markets.

The show was created by Elise Doganieri and Bertram van Munster, who, along with Jonathan Littman, serve as executive producers. The show is produced by Earthview Inc. (headed by Doganieri and van Munster), Bruckheimer Television for CBS Television Studios and ABC Studios (a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company). The series has been hosted by veteran New Zealand television personality Phil Keoghan since its inception.

Since the inception of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program in 2003, The Amazing Race has won it ten out of twelve times; the show has also won other awards and commendations. Although it has moved around several prime time slots since its inception, the program has averaged about 10 million viewers per season.

In the next season of the Amazing Race, Big Brother alums take the spotlight. The show, will kick off on September 25th, to coincide with the season finale of Big Brother 27, creating a fascinating overlap for fans. 

The teams, made up of former Big Brother players, will jett off from LAX on March 16th, heading first for Amsterdam, the birthplace of Big Brother.

Among the participants from Big Brother were Enzo Palumbo from BB 12 and BB 22, Natalie Negroti from BB 18, Cat Dunn from BB 21, and Taylor Hale and Kyland Young from BB 24. Other notable names included Joseph Abden from BB 24, Jag Bains from BB 25, and Chelsea Bayham from BB 26.

The Amazing Race originally started (in season 1) in the Netherlands.  And will begin it's first leg there too.  The show will end with the final pit stop at Yankee Stadium, New York City, on April 9, 2025. Teams were eliminated at different points, with Enzo and his brother Jag being the first ones out. Lexi and Angela Murray from BB 26 were eliminated in Prague, Czech Republic, and the newlyweds Megan and Turner were out in Koonahora, Czech Republic.

The filming has ended and here is what we know so far from leaks. 

The remaining teams raced through Budapest, Dubrovnik, Bucharest, Athens, and finally Paris. The last three teams were Joseph and his brother Adam, Jag and his brother, and Kyland and Taylor. In the end, it was Jag Bains and his brother Jas who reportedly crossed the finish line first, securing another reality TV win for Jag.

Amazing Race spoilers are in this video.
 
Amazing Race 38 this season includes all Big Brother alumni such as Izzy Gleicher, Jag Bains, Chelsie Baham, Tucker Des Lauriers and Taylor Hale, leading to a crossover experience. 

On the Amazing Race Izzy Gleicher's animosity towards Jag Bains, who won Big Brother, has been a highlight of the season. Izzy's reactions to Taylor Hale giving Jag the express pass have been quite entertaining. However, the biggest shocker might be the rumored breakup of Taylor Hale and Kyland Young, even before the Amazing Race started. Despite this, they've maintained the facade of being a couple for the CBS show.

Another interesting tidbit is Taylor's continued good relations with her ex, Joseph Abdin, who's also racing. Rubina Bernabe and Tucker Des Lauriers too, reportedly ended their relationship after Amazing Race 38 finished filming. 

As for Amazing Race spoilers for the upcoming episode, the teams will have to fill bottles of beer for a roadblock, which is expected to shake up the race dynamics. The top 3 teams consisting of Jag and Jas, Natalie Negrotti and Stephanie Negrotti, and Joseph Abdin and Adam Abdin, are speculated to hit the driver’s seat first, with the power to decide the other teams' workloads. 

Unfortunately, Matt Turner and Megan Turner will be eliminated in the next episode of Amazing Race 38. Stay tuned for more updates and behind-the-scenes news on Amazing Race 38 and the post-Big Brother antics of the houseguests.

From the lingering fallout of last week’s double U-Turn to shifting alliances and surprise comebacks, Brice and Brooke unpack all the drama, strategy, and laughs that made this episode a wild one.

🧂 What went down:

• Detour choices: “Bag It Up” (load wheelbarrows with 20-21 lb bags of salt and deliver them in the shipping yard) or “Pull It Up” (row a boat into Mali Ston Bay, haul up three oyster buoys, deliver to a restaurant).  
￼
• Roadblock: One team member must study a relief map of Ston, locate three shields/facts around town, return and correctly answer questions—every attempt gives different questions. Those who don’t finish quickly risked falling behind.  ￼

• Strategic shifting: Teams that previously raced ahead found themselves stumbling. One team’s boat trouble quickly turned into a wake-up call.  ￼

• Alliance implications: With the salt and oyster tasks demanding endurance, precision and teamwork, underlying cracks in alliances began to surface. Who worked together? Who didn’t? Brice and Brooke break it down.

This Athens leg had EVERYTHING:

🔥 A live U-Turn vote that instantly blew up alliances
⚡ A tie-breaking revote that backfired in real time
💥 THREE teams U-Turned at once — chaos unleashed
🫒 An olive-tasting Detour that tested tastebuds AND patience
🔤 A Greek-alphabet Roadblock that sent racers spiraling
🇬🇷 And scenic Athens backdrops framing some of the tensest moments of the season

With James in the Pit Stop studio, Brice and Brooke dig into:

• Who handled the U-Turn twist like pros — and who crumbled
• How strategy shifted once the live vote went sideways
• The toughest moments from the Detour and Roadblock
• Whether this twist helped or hurt certain teams down the stretch
• The funniest, pettiest, and most iconic moments of the episode

It’s insightful, it’s chaotic, it’s hilarious — and it’s everything fans love about Pit Stop recaps.

Brice Izyah and Brooke Camhi are back at the Pitstop, and this week’s Amazing Race chaos is brought to you by giant eggs, no taxis, and maximum confusion. Episode 8 of The Amazing Race Season 38 takes teams to Bucharest, Romania, where one of the funniest and most frustrating Roadblocks of the season unfolds — and yes, those enormous painted eggs steal the entire show.

Tensions rise, alliances wobble, laughter erupts, and strategy is tested as teams push through Romania’s capital with determination (and maybe a little delusion).

Brice and Brooke break down:

• The giant egg Roadblock that cracked the teams wide open

• Romania’s no-taxi nightmare and how it shifted the leaderboard

• Which teams stayed cool and who started… well… scrambling

• Strategic decisions, messy moments, and standout performances

• All the laughs, drama, chaos, and heart that Episode 8 delivered

Brice Izyah and Brooke Camhi are back at the Pit Stop to break down all the intensity, emotion, and pure travel-day chaos from The Amazing Race Season 38, Episode 10 — “It’s Hard Not to Feel Hopeless.”

This leg takes teams to Milan, Italy, where everything from heat exhaustion to tough terrain pushes racers to their limits. One team starts the leg a full hour behind, another struggles under the weight of exhaustion and frustration, and a father–daughter duo faces one of their most disorienting navigational days yet. Between tough Roadblocks, confusing directions, and the pressure that comes with a dwindling field, Episode 10 delivers tension from start to finish.

Brice and Brooke break down:

• The Italy challenges that tested every ounce of grit
• How teams handled exhaustion, heat, and high pressure

• What the edit was foreshadowing — and what really mattered

• The team that fought through being an hour behind

• The duo unraveling in the chaos and trying to hold it together

• Strategic choices that saved leg placements (or nearly tanked them)

• Funniest, wildest, and most “ARE YOU SERIOUS?” moments of the episode

With laughs, real talk, and all the frantic energy of Race Day, this Pit Stop unpacking gets into the heart, heat, and hustle of Episode 10.

This wild leg takes us from Sweden to the bogs of Estonia, where teams are pushed to their physical, mental, and emotional limits:

• Serve: Strip down and face off against locals in a mud volleyball match until scoring 5 points.
• Sling: Strap into bog shoes and fire off vegetables with a slingshot to destroy a table full of cabbage. It’s giving muddy madness either way!

🔥 Speed Bump: As non-elimination leg survivors, Gary & Matt must find the legendary Saunabuss, strip down, and sweat it out for 5 minutes with Estonian locals—completely naked. Yes, it’s as wild as it sounds.

Greg brings amazing insight as a recent winner, comparing TAR 15’s challenges to modern gameplay. Expect laughs, behind-the-scenes tea, and plenty of messy Pitstop energy.

THE AMAZING RACE host Phil Keoghan invites some of BIG BROTHER’s fiercest former competitors to exit the house and race in the real world when 13 fan-favorite houseguests embark on a European adventure with their travel companion, on the 38th season of the CBS Original series THE AMAZING RACE, Thursday, Sept. 25 (9:00-10:30 PM, ET/PT). The Emmy® Award winner moves to its regular Wednesday time period on Wednesday, Oct. 1 (9:30-11:00 PM, ET/PT), on the CBS Television Network

The Houseguests-turned-Racers kick off the season in Amsterdam where they face classic game pieces and unexpected twists right off the bat. For the first time in THE AMAZING RACE history, teams face their first challenge before even lining up on the starting line –the first team to complete the task receives an express pass and the last team to complete the task faces the consequences of a Hazard. Along the route, teams will reach new heights in Prague, bathe like a king in Budapest and skydive nearly 13,000 feet over Romania.

“THE AMAZING RACE takes the Racers and viewers on an unforgettable journey,” said co-creators and executive producers Bertram van Munster and Elise Doganieri. “With a traveling crew of over 100 people, over the course of 38 seasons, we have traveled to nearly 100 countries and over 1 million miles, an extraordinary feat of storytelling and logistics. For this season, it was fun to bring the former BIG BROTHER players out of the house and on an adventure in the real world, as the Race is a global triumph that continues to inspire and connect people all over the world.”","#amazingrace,Amazingrace38,TAR38",24,829,12,27,PT1M1S,hd,public,

Jesse is also racing in memory of his late father, who loved watching the show, and had dreamed to one day run it with one of his kids.

Jesse Harink (he/him) 
Hometown: Sherwood Park, Alberta
Current: Vancouver, BC 
Occupation: Human Resources
Strengths: Problem solving, physical strength, and optimism/energy 
Fear/phobia: Heights
Pet peeve about your teammate: Jonathon is always right, and it’s not that he thinks he’s always right, he genuinely always is. Sometimes, when I want to outsmart Jonathon, I don’t, and it’s so frustrating.
What will you do with the prize money? There would be the responsible side, which includes RRSPs, TFSA, FHSA, and all that. After that, I would love to dedicate time to spend with my family. I moved away from Alberta more than 10 years ago and would love to come back more often to make more memories with my family, especially my nieces and nephews! Also, the goal is also to see Cher’s final tour with my mom (Cher has promised another)!

Jonathon Braun (he/him) 
Hometown: Woodlawn, Ont.
Current: Vancouver, BC
Occupation: Lawyer (Non-Profit Legal Director)
Strengths: I'm good at logic puzzles and party games. I love bringing people together and forming community. I’m also a strategist.
Fear/phobia: Enclosed spaces
Pet peeve about your teammate: Jesse emits loud belches out of nowhere. I don’t know whether I find this gross or hilarious.
What will you do with the prize money? Take my parents on a trip, and put a down payment on an apartment.

Amazing Grace (en directo)
Amazing Grace (ao vivo)


""Amazing Grace"" is the closing track on Il Divo's fourth studio album, The Promise (November 2008), which peaked at No.1 on the Billboard classical chart and spent 43 straight weeks in the Top 10.
On 24 October 2008, about to leave on their post-recording vacation, Il Divo abruptly changed their travel plans to take a red-eye overseas flight to the US for a special performance of ""Amazing Grace"" on The Oprah Winfrey Show, after Oprah herself called to invite them.

«Amazing Grace» es la canción que cierra el cuarto álbum de estudio de Il Divo, The Promise (noviembre de 2008), que alcanzó el número 1 en la lista de clásicos de Billboard y permaneció 43 semanas seguidas en el Top 10.
El 24 de octubre de 2008, a punto de salir de vacaciones tras la grabación, Il Divo cambió abruptamente sus planes de viaje y tomó un vuelo transoceánico a Estados Unidos para una interpretación especial de «Amazing Grace» en The Oprah Winfrey Show, después de que la propia Oprah les llamara para invitarles.

“Amazing Grace” é a faixa que encerra o quarto álbum do Il Divo, chamado The Promise (novembro de 2008). Ela alcançou a primeira posição na tabela músical da categoria clássica da Billboard e ficou 43 semanas seguidas entre as top 10.
Em 24 de outubro de 2008, quando estavam prestes a sair de férias após gravar o disco, o Il Divo mudou abruptamente os planos de viagem. Eles se lançaram em um voo corujão, em uma viagem transatlântica rumo aos EUA para realizar uma performance especial de “Amazing Grace” no programa The Oprah Winfrey Show, depois de a própria Oprah ligar fazendo o convite.

Lyrics

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now I’m found,
Was blind but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come.
’Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.
When we’ve been here ten thousand years,
Bright, shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now I’m found,
Was blind but now I see.

Amazing Race S38 – Episode 9 Panel Recap | GREECE BRINGS THE CHAOS!!! 🔥,GbfMRJ9OMYo,Lori's Fab Vlog,UCD9P0670hZozd1xJ_udHwgA,2025-11-21T18:50:17Z,"Buckle up, Race fam… because Athens, Greece gave us the MOST dramatic episode of the season—maybe the franchise. So many “firsts,” so many gasps, and SO MUCH TEA spilled in this week's recap panel!

For the first time ever in Amazing Race history, we saw a LIVE Double U-Turn Vote where:
Every team got TWO votes ❗

The votes determined TWO teams to be U-Turned ❗

AND when the second U-Turn resulted in a TIE…
 ➜ REVOTE.
 ➜ STILL TIED!
 ➜ Result? THREE TEAMS U-TURNED!!!
 Absolute. HISTORIC. CHAOS.

And we had the perfect guests to break it all down.

👑 Reality Royalty Joins the Panel: Brendon & Rachel (Team Brenchel!)
These two are LEGENDS for a reason—Brendon with two seasons each of BB & TAR, and Rachel with THREE of each. Their old-school perspective added so much spice, strategy, and iconic commentary (as always). Seriously… we could listen to them talk strategy all day.

🔥 Jas & Jag Bring the Behind-the-Scenes Tea
Our powerhouse current-season duo didn’t hold back. And can we talk about their performance?!
 They became the FIRST TEAM EVER to be U-Turned… survive… AND WIN THE LEG.
 An absolutely dominant showing, and the behind-the-scenes insights they shared? GOLD.

😢 Missing Kyland & Taylor
We were sad they couldn’t join this week, but we’re hoping to get them on a future episode—because you KNOW they’d have had a lot to say about this leg.

🧭 Breaking Down the Leg Design
We dive into all the chaos surrounding the U-Turn vote and whether teams seriously misplayed their strategy.
 And then: the Detour!
""Music in the Air"" versus ""Olives Everywhere""

Were the tasks just too easy? Or are the remaining teams simply operating on an elite level at this point? Let us know if you agree with our panel's take!

🪨 The Sisyphean Boulder Task
The Active Route Info challenge was equal parts hilarious and brutal. Scott’s campaigning HARD to see more ARIs added to every leg…
 What about you? Would you have added something tougher to this leg? What challenge would YOU design if you were on production?

👀 Tucker & Eric’s Achilles' Heel
Fans have asked for WEEKS what these two aren’t good at…
 And Athens answered:
 The lowercase Greek alphabet.
 Chelsie crushed it. Tucker spiraled. And unfortunately, that spelled (literally) the end of the road for this incredibly strong team.
We hate to see Titans fall, but you could feel the shockwave and celebration at the mat from the final four teams—everybody suddenly realizing that their chances just skyrocketed.

🎤 YOUR TURN
What were YOUR feelings about this episode?
 Did the voting strategy make sense?
 Should teams have played it differently?
 Are Jas & Jag unstoppable now??
 Tell us everything in the comments!

 👇 DROP YOUR THOUGHTS 👇
 • Who should the teams have U-Turned?
 • Were the Detour tasks too easy or perfectly balanced?
 • Do you think Jas & Jag are the team to beat now?
 We’ll be replying to comments for the next 24 hours, so jump in!

And we’ve got the perfect panel to unpack it all.

Joining us for this wild ride:
💃 **Hannah & Simone** – current racers who are here to spill ALL the behind-the-scenes tea from this unforgettable leg in **Budapest, Hungary!** They open up about their controversial train decision (three stops vs. the direct sleeper train to Prague 👀), their *ten-attempt* Roadblock grind, and the unbelievable redemption that followed in the Detour — a dance challenge so good Phil himself called it one of the FASTEST EVER completed on *The Amazing Race!*
🎙️ **Special Guest Fan Slot:** We’re joined by the one and only **Reality TV editor from Parade magazine** and **lead podcaster from Rob Has a Podcast (RHAP)** — a true *Super Fan* who always brings the perfect blend of insight, humor, and tough love for all the racers.

Together, we dive deep into:
🚂 The *train debate* that had everyone talking — which one would YOU have chosen?
👑 The **Active Route Info: “Search for a King”** – was it too easy, or just the right amount of challenge?
🐎 The **Roadblock: “Coach Your Carriage”** – some teams handled it like pros, others... not so much.
🎭 The **Detour:** “Juggling Act” vs. “Balancing Act” – which would you have picked, and which strategy actually paid off?

This episode was packed with drama, laughter, and an inspiring story of perseverance — and our panel doesn’t hold back in breaking it all down.

Drop a comment below:
➡️ What did YOU think about Hannah & Simone’s massive comeback?
➡️ Would you have taken the direct train or gone for the early one with stops?
➡️ And which Detour would have been your jam: Juggling or Balancing?

Let’s talk strategy, mishaps, and those unforgettable Budapest vibes together! 🌍✨

Today, Rob, Jess, and Mike discuss episode 2 of The Amazing Race 38.

The Amazing Race 38 speeds through Prague in episode 2, with Rob Cesternino, Jessica Liese, and Mike Bloom breaking down all the action. From train station chaos to towering challenges, this episode showcases the unpredictable nature of the race and the impact of sleep deprivation on team performance.

The podcast dives into the unexpected turn of events when eight teams mistakenly disembarked at the wrong Berlin stop, leading to a scramble to reach Prague. This mistake reshuffled team placements and added an extra layer of drama to the leg. The hosts discuss how exhaustion played a significant role in team decision-making, particularly for Angela and Lexi, who were ultimately eliminated.

Rob, Jessica, and Mike discuss:
- Jag and Jazz's continued dominance and strategic alliance-building
- Impact of sleep deprivation on team performance, especially for back-of-pack teams
- Megan and Matt's narrow escape from elimination for the second leg in a row
- Teams adapting to memory-based challenges, with some excelling and others struggling
- Preview of next episode's ""Driver's Seat"" twist, allowing one team to assign tasks to others

As teams settle into the race, alliances are forming and strategies are evolving. Will Jag and Jazz's early lead make them targets, or can they maintain their momentum? Tune in for a detailed analysis of each team's performance and insights into the race dynamics shaping this season of The Amazing Race.

Rob Cesternino, Jessica Liese, and Mike Bloom are back for another incredible journey around the world watching The Amazing Race! Our TAR experts will be back with a recap each and every week! Make sure to also tune into our weekly exit interview with the eliminated team.

Today, Jess and Mike discuss episode 3 of The Amazing Race 38.

The race wrapped up its stay in the Czech Republic with stops like Ka Hora, featuring agrarian challenges with beer, barley, straw, and hockey. The Turners were eliminated after finishing last for the third time.

The big story was the return of the Driver’s Seat, where the top three teams formed a rare alliance to assign tasks—leveraging strategy in a way rarely seen on TAR. Natalie and Stephanie gained power, directing heavier burdens to rivals while helping allies with old-school “MapQuest-style” directions. This raised debate about whether teamwork crossed into breaking the spirit of the race.

Team Highlights

Natalie & Stephanie: 1st, winning $2,500 and emerging as front-runners.
Jass & Jag: 2nd, intentionally holding back to avoid being targets.
Tucker & Eric: 3rd, rebounded despite major hockey struggles.
Joseph & Adam: 4th, entertaining chaos with lost keys and beer mishaps.
Hannah & Simone: 5th, adding comic relief and Czech language attempts.
Rebina & Christine: 7th, detoured early but recovered.
Kylind & Taylor: 9th, contrasting communication styles on display.
Cat & Alex: 10th, lovable chaos at the bottom.
The Turners: Eliminated after a misdirected detour and Megan’s rib injury.

What Mike and Jessica Said
They were thrilled about the return of the Driver’s Seat, calling it “a literal tribunal” and noting it finally delivered on Phil’s promise of more strategy this season. They compared it to Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains for how alliances were used.

They joked about the “MapQuest”–style printed directions teams shared, debating whether that broke the spirit of the race and even whether trailing teams could legally grab them.

They praised Natalie & Stephanie, saying Stephanie in particular looked like a season favorite, and were impressed by Natalie scoring “five-hole” in the hockey Roadblock.

They laughed at Adam & Joseph’s chaos (beer pouring struggles, lost car keys) and speculated the edit was setting them up for a deep run because of all the personal backstory.

They teased Jass & Jag’s strategy, saying they “literally threw the comp” like Big Brother players to avoid being seen as too dominant.

They enjoyed Hannah’s comic relief and her attempts at Czech, calling it fun “sound bite energy.”

They found Rebina & Christine’s pit stop misfire hilarious, noting it was somehow survivable thanks to how stratified the leg was.

They admitted they want Cat & Alex to stick around despite being bad racers—just for the entertainment factor.

They were sympathetic toward the Turners’ elimination, especially Megan’s rib injury, while noting the irony that it was their “best leg” before getting misdirected.

Looking ahead, they were excited for Budapest, praising the Rubik’s cube Fast Forward as “brilliant game design” because it wouldn’t just reward arriving first.

Next Stop
The race moves to Budapest, Hungary, with circus tasks, acrobatics, and a Rubik’s cube Fast Forward that won’t guarantee victory just by arriving first.

"Strategy, Chaos & the Train Wreck Alliance! Melissa Deni Talks The Amazing Race Season 38 Ep 3",LgQK6_WUqJI,RHAP: We Know Reality TV,UCo-cYYMN4rUc5zk2Kr5GTTg,2025-10-12T21:33:16Z,"SUBSCRIBE to RHAP at: https://link.chtbl.com/rhap

Host Mike Bloom welcomes Melissa Deni, fan-favorite Big Brother analyst and lifelong Amazing Race viewer, for a dive into one of the most strategic and chaotic seasons yet. This “incredibly Big Brother-based” edition of The Amazing Race 38 has transformed the globe-trotting competition into a social strategy game—and Melissa has takes.

Melissa admits the season has “exceeded my expectations,” praising how alliances and gameplay echo Big Brother’s best seasons. She and Mike dissect the rise of the Train Wreck Alliance—a three-team pact between Natalie Negrotti, Stephanie Negrotti, and Joseph Abdin that shared directions, gifted a birthday win, and deflected attention in true Big Brother fashion. Melissa especially loves that the alliance members—known more for personality than cutthroat gameplay—are unexpectedly thriving strategically.

They also break down standout team performances: Jag and Jas Bains’ near-perfect dominance; Natalie and Stephanie Negrotti’s surprising physical and tactical strength; and Taylor Hale and Kyland Young’s puzzling ninth-place stumble after early promise. Melissa laments the loss of Matt and Megan Turner, her favorite “fun-quote team,” while applauding Kat Dunn and Alex Romo for their kindness and chemistry.

Along the way, Mike and Melissa unpack Amazing Race mechanics—the Roadblock quota rule, post-leg isolation policy, and the “Driver’s Seat” twist that mirrors a Big Brother Head of Household power. As the Race heads to Budapest, Melissa is rooting for more personality-driven casting in future seasons—and maybe even a return for Zach Rance.

Peridiam explains that TAR was his “original darling” of the CBS trifecta—something he watched from the very beginning before drifting away and then binge-reigniting his fandom in the mid-2010s with his wife, now the bigger TAR fan. Though best known for his Big Brother and Survivor coverage, he’s touched TAR only occasionally, including a Season 5 recap once shown by Colin and Christie to their family.

From the BB perspective, Peridiam rates TAR 38 slightly above average, enjoying how knowing the alumni elevates the season. He highlights dominant frontrunners Jag & Jazz and Tucker & Eric, praises the entertainment value of teams like Izzy & Paige, and roots for pairs such as Joseph & Adam. He and Mike also unpack odd strategic decisions, early exits, and the looming double U-turn—where old BB tensions could finally resurface.

Ethanimale joins Mike to weigh in on strategy, team dynamics, and cross-show reality TV connections, highlighting the intense competition as just five teams remain.

The conversation centers on the shock elimination of Tucker and Eric, how social gameplay surfaces through tools like the U-turn vote, and the power of pre-existing relationships and Big Brother-style alliances. Ethanimale shares the emotional highs and lows from binge-watching the season, giving a fan’s perspective on how different viewing habits shape investment. Discussion also turns to the challenge design, with surprising behind-the-scenes ties to Big Brother 25 and how physicality affects female/female teams' chances.

Mike and Ethanimale discuss:
-Deep dive into the U-turn vote, exploring whether Big Brother strategy translates to The Amazing Race and how teams handle social pressure
-Ethanimale unpacks his top three emotional moments, including a non-elimination near-miss, team encouragement, and seeing friends eliminated
-Analysis of team strengths and weaknesses, such as Jag & Jas’ navigation skill and Chelsea’s dynamic race with her father Jack
-Exploration of underdog success stories and how task design favors certain pairings, with Izzy and Paige’s path through tough detours in focus
-Real talk about diabetes representation in Adam’s race, with both hosts discussing the balance between pushing through and staying safe

Who holds the edge as the finale approaches—can Joseph and Adam pull off a heroic win, or will frontrunners like Jag & Jas run away with the prize? Strategic voting, alliance secrecy, and team resilience set up a tense finish.

Catch the full episode for in-depth takes on social strategy, race mechanics, and all the behind-the-scenes details from your favorite Big Brother alumni running The Amazing Race.

Psalms 105:2
Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
Psalms 135:3

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far
And Grace will lead us home
And Grace will lead us home

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Was blind, but now I see




Amazing Grace was written by Rev. John Newton (July 24, 1725 -- Dec. 21, 1807) for a sermon he preached on January 1, 1773. At the time Rev. Newton was writing a new hymn for each of his sermons he preached

Hi! We're Will and James! After meeting in 2014, we knew it was love at first sight. Our very first trip together was to New York City where we learned very quickly, that if we travel together we can do anything. Our love has continued to grow and so has our sense of adventure leading us to places all over the world. We document our travels to share with you, hoping to inspire you to grab someone you love and travel the world.  Recently, we competed on the 32nd season of The Amazing Race where we not only won the grand prize but got engaged at the finish line, the first gay/LGBT proposal in the show's 20-year history. Join us on all of our adventures!
