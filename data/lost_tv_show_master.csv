===================================

Easter Egg Nr. 10: Lost TV Show

In Batman: Arkham City there are some references to the ABC TV Show ""Lost"", one of the most popular television series of all time.

Mark Hamill, who voiced the Joker in the game, is a huge fan of the show.

In a small speech during the game, Joker makes a reference to the ""Lost"" finale by pointing out how it might be disappointing to know all the answers.

""How come it all ended in a church?""

In Arkham City you can also hear thugs saying: ""I forget, do they ever explain what the island was?""

This is a clear reference to the mysterious island of the TV show ""Lost"".

Die Spannung wird durch immer neue EnthÃ¼llungen â€“ und daraus resultierende verÃ¤nderte Betrachtungsweisen der Serie und einzelner Szenen â€“ erzeugt, wobei verschiedene Aspekte der Handlung nach und nach miteinander in Verbindung gebracht und verknÃ¼pft werden.

Zu den erhaltenen Auszeichnungen gehÃ¶ren ein Golden Globe sowie acht Emmys, einer davon als Beste Dramaserie im Jahr 2005. Die Serie startete am 22. September 2004 auf dem US-amerikanischen Network ABC. Die letzte Staffel endete in den USA am 23. Mai 2010. Die Serie wurde auch im deutschsprachigen Raum ausgestrahlt.

Show Runner der Serie, und somit Hauptverantwortliche fÃ¼r den Handlungsverlauf, waren Damon Lindelof und Carlton Cuse. Produziert wurde Lost von den ABC Studios, J. J. Abramsâ€™ Produktionsfirma Bad Robot Productions und Grass Skirt Productions.",PT24M27S,7904.0,public,2025-01-23T12:59:27Z,"lost,lost serie,lost erklÃ¤rt,lost explained,alle lost staffeln,lost jack,lost monster,lost john locke,lost dharma initiative,dharma initiative,smoke monster,lost finale,lost finale erklÃ¤rt,jack locke,benjamin linus,desmond,jacob lost,desmond lost,kate lost,sawyer lost",Diese Serie hat mich verÃ¤ndert: LOST | Review,87482,False,,2025-12-09

After five seasons of survival, melodrama, time travel, and other wild twists and turns, LOST went into its final season with historical anticipation. The penultimate season ended with one of the craziest cliffhangers in long form storytelling, leaving the final season in uncharted territory. The final season of LOST introduces a major new storytelling element, THE FLASH SIDEWAYS, which was just one of many reasons THE ENDING OF LOST is probably the most divisive ending of all time.

qXKh0ctZwzk,24,,Charlie Sinne ,1.0,hd,"BrainFeed was an enigmatic and short-lived television program that aired on Channel 69 in Climax, Kentucky. Marketed as a show designed to stimulate viewers' minds, it instead delivered content that was often nonsensical and directionless, leading to widespread confusion and frustration among its audience. The abstract nature of the program prompted numerous viewers to write letters of complaint to the station. After just two episodes, the station manager decided to cancel the show due to the overwhelming negative feedback.â€‹

Years later, fragments of ""BrainFeed"" resurfaced when a box of VHS tapes was donated to a local Goodwill store. A VHS collector purchased the tapes and, upon discovering the partial recordings of the show, digitized the footage. This unexpected find has since piqued the interest of media enthusiasts and historians, serving as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of television programming and the importance of preserving even the most obscure broadcasts.â€‹",PT48S,6.0,public,2025-04-09T11:29:20Z,,BrainFeed Lost TV Show #gameshows #brainteasers #badshow,1069,False,,2025-12-09

#lost is an American drama television series that aired on ABC from September 22, 2004, to May 23, 2010, over six seasons, comprising a total of 121 episodes. The show contains elements of supernatural and science fiction, and follows the survivors of a commercial jet airliner flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, after the plane crashes on a mysterious island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean. The story is told in a heavily serialized manner. Episodes typically feature a primary storyline set on the island, augmented by flashback or flashforward sequences which provide additional insight into the involved characters.

Inspired by the 2000 Tom Hanks film Cast Away, Lost was created by Jeffrey Lieber, J. J. Abrams, and Damon Lindelof, who share story writing credits for the pilot episode, which Abrams directed. Throughout the show's run, Lindelof and Carlton Cuse served as showrunners and head writers, working together with many other executive producers and writers. Due to its large ensemble cast and the cost of filming primarily on location in Oahu, Hawaii, the series was one of the most expensive on television, with the pilot alone costing over $14 million. The fictional universe and mythology of Lost were expanded upon by a number of related media, most importantly, a series of short mini-episodes called Missing Pieces, and a 12-minute epilogue titled ""The New Man in Charge"".

Lost has regularly been ranked by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. The first season had an estimated average of 16 million viewers per episode on ABC. During its sixth and final season, the show averaged over 11 million U.S. viewers per episode. Lost was the recipient of hundreds of industry award nominations throughout its run and won numerous of these awards, including the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 2005, Best American Import at the British Academy Television Awards in 2005, the Golden Globe Award for Best Drama in 2006, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Drama Series.

r1N9nA8NK1s,24,,Collider,37.0,hd,"Lost captivated audiences from the very beginning with its intricate mythology and mystery box approach to storytelling. The show's sixth and final season, however, proved divisive, as it diverged from fan expectations by prioritizing character resolutions while leaving a lot of questions unanswered.

Initially, ""Lost"" seemed relatively straight forward as a series, but as things went on, more and more sci-fi weirdness was introduced. Season 6 saw the survivors attempting to prevent the plane crash, aiming to alter the island's fate. Cuz nothing screams easily understandable narrative, quite like timeline manipulation.

Despite audiences expecting concrete resolutions, the final season prioritized metaphysical closure, exploring the characters' emotional journeys. The flash sideways, initially perceived as inconsequential, laid the foundation for the poignant series finale. While opinions on the conclusion are mixed at best, Lost remains a unique and iconic show, that many of us still talk about today, standing as a one-of-a-kind project yet to be matched in the television landscape.",PT56S,1390.0,public,2023-11-28T13:00:45Z,"lost,j j abrams,season 6,season finale,ending explained,timeline,alternate timeline,the island,polar bear,short,collider,afterlife",Lost Season Finale Ending Explained! #lost #jjabrams #endingexplained,73764,False,,2025-12-09

WU5cgEGdSCA,10,,Corey Light,3.0,hd,"The Brass Tax, lone survivors of a lost psychedelic television show!
This Winchester, Massachusetts area band appeared on the short lived TV show N.H. Bandstand shown on WMUR-9 in Manchester, New Hampshire.
This show featured live local bands and aired film clips of national acts for only a few episodes between 1967-68 before vanishing. This show was a hotspot for local teens as they got chance to be on tv during the dancing segments!
Until now ALL recordings of this show were lost and likely no longer exist as the film was erased to record other shows in an attempt to help the studio save money.
50+ years later a lone cassette emerged from a band member as the result of our extensive search for any remnants. Unheard by the public since the airdate on April 13th, 1968, you can now catch the full show only on Tape Stack!

In this video, I dive deep into what made LOST a cultural phenomenon, where it stumbled, and why its legacy remains so polarizing.

Turns out there were a ton of medical moments throughout the series, anchored by Matthew Fox as Dr. Jack Shephard. I reacted to the opening pilot sequence on the beach, Evangeline Lilly as Kate stitching Jack’s wound, Jack saving Charlie with some chest compressions/chest thumps, Sayid sealing Charlie’s head wound with fire, Jack performing spinal surgery on Ben’s tumor, Juliet giving Jack an appendectomy, and the wild “Do Not Harm” episode where John Locke brings Boone in with a broken leg while Claire is giving birth. So much drama. Any scenes I missed that you want me to react to in a future video? Drop them down below!

The ending of Lost is famously ambiguous, but it's not a leap to suppose that the 'Sideways' is a product of the electromagnetism/Light, which we already know is also the cause of miracles and the Monster. All of these phenomena fall under the umbrella of the 'magic/mystery box' that feeds flashbacks and inner conflict into the supernatural mysteries. Ben had more of a grasp on it than most, but when he told the truth for once, no one believed him. Remember that Ben half-understood the 'judgement' of the Monster, as it fed on his past guilt, like it does to everyone in the show, Jacob included.",PT28S,524.0,public,2024-06-28T20:00:10Z,,LOST Ending Explained: Detail You Missed [SPOILER] #lost #shorts #tv #scifi #dharma #explained,35358,False,,2025-12-09

Lost ended on May 23, 2010, and not a day goes by in the last decade where I donâ€™t think about how much this show means to me. Truly, more than I can even write here, this show has changed my life and will always hold a huge space in my heart.

This is one of my favorite series finales: the first time I watched it every single â€œrememberâ€ scene had me sobbing and I watched the last 30 minutes in a haze blurred by my tears. Because Lost was about found family, acceptance, love, and true companionship and the finale highlighted that in a really beautiful way. 

Lost said that your past doesnâ€™t need to define you, that everyone can change and be better and that there are people in your life who can help you along that journey. It really took all these people who seemingly had nothing in common and said that they can be friends, they can be family. I just love that message so much and I adore these complicated, flawed, human, yet completely lovable characters so much. 

So hereâ€™s a tribute to that, and to the finale that ties that all together. For someone who has defined a life by this show (hello hurleybird), I have struggled immensely in attempting to edit it. For me, capturing all my feelings and emotions and making tributes to Lost seems impossible and anything I make inadequate. But hereâ€™s my attempt, short and sweet, and I hope my fellow Losties enjoy.

xbYU1vfEDJI,24,,JoBlo Originals,1024.0,hd,"How did a show like Land of the Lost ever get made? The 70s saw some really wild television.  It seemed like TV networks were willing to try anything at least once.  From shows about space age garbage men named Quark, Bionic Couples, or couples who are actually elements like the little known BBC series Sapphire and Steel.  Anything and everything was game for at least one season.
Childrenâ€™s programming was even more bizarre, as networks tried to engage kids and teens alike in a time when psychedelic was the norm.  When it came to family and kidâ€™s TV though, there was one duo who stood proud with a legacy that would dominate the 70s when it came to family programming and put the variety into the word â€œvariety showâ€.  That duo was Sid and Marty Krofft, and they would be the creators of some of the most iconic TV series to come out of that decade. This would be the era that birthed projects like the Star Wars Holiday Special and several other â€œthat was a choiceâ€ holiday themed entertainment.

The Kroffts though, would let their imaginations fly and would go all out with the art and ideas wherever it took take them.  It was within this library of imagination that the Kroffts dived into the land of science fiction and fantasy. The viewers would find themselves lost in that land, along with a dad and his two kids who were just on a routine expedition.

Thatâ€™s right kids, grab hold of your life jackets and cuddle a Sleestak, because in this episode of Gone But Not Forgotten weâ€™re heading into the Land of The Lost.  But, we wonâ€™t be totally lost as weâ€™re going to be guided by not one, not two, but three of the stars of the series as weâ€™re joined by Will and Holly. Yes, thatâ€™s right, Wesley Eure, and Kathy Coleman and Cha-Ka himself Phillip Paley are here to give us an insight into the magical land.  So, letâ€™s dive over that waterfall into The Land of the Lost!

Let us know what you want us to cover on Gone But Not Forgotten in the comments!

MASH, Cheers, Babylon 5, and Buffy are a few that come to mind. But one the most memorable, was a series about people stranded on a desert island no, not Gilligan's island and no, I am not talking about survivor either. It was of course LOST. This series was not a silly TV show, it was a game-changer. It wasn't focused on storylines but rather a perfect combination of characters and mysteries. Lost is one of those series that still sparks strong emotions from people. Many people love it or hate it. But is the hate for this show misplaced? Is it really that bad or could LOST be one of the greatest TV shows of all time? Let's explore the Island in this episode of Gone but Not Forgotten.

Lost is an American science fiction drama television series created by Jeffrey Lieber, J.J. Abrams, and Damon Lindelof that aired on ABC from September 22, 2004, to May 23, 2010, over six seasons, comprising a total of 121 episodes. The show contains elements of supernatural fiction, and follows the survivors of a commercial jet airliner flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, after the plane crashes on a mysterious island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean. Episodes typically feature a primary storyline set on the island, augmented by flashback or flashforward sequences which provide additional insight into the involved characters.

Lindelof and Carlton Cuse serve as showrunners and are executive producers along with Abrams and Bryan Burk. Inspired by the 2000 Tom Hanks film Cast Away, the show is told in a heavily serialized manner. Due to its large ensemble cast and the cost of filming primarily on location in Oahu, Hawaii, the series was one of the most expensive on television, with the pilot alone costing over $14 million. The fictional universe and mythology of Lost were expanded upon by a number of related media, most importantly, a series of short mini-episodes called Missing Pieces, and a 12-minute epilogue titled ""The New Man in Charge"".

Lost has regularly been ranked by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. The first season had an estimated average of 16 million viewers per episode on ABC. During its sixth and final season, the show averaged over 11 million U.S. viewers per episode. Lost was the recipient of hundreds of industry award nominations throughout its run and won numerous of these awards, including the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 2005, Best American Import at the British Academy Television Awards in 2005, the Golden Globe Award for Best Drama in 2006, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Drama Series.

Ultimately, the ABC drama disappointed a lot of viewers with “The End,” as it seemed to go in a predictable and unsatisfying direction, but there might be more to the show’s final episode than you realized the first time. From the truth about whether the characters actually died in a plane wreck to the meaning of all those scenes set in an alternate reality, let’s take a look at the explanation of the ending of Lost.

Und auch das Finale der Serie hat die Zuschauer vÃ¶llig verwirrt. Wenn ihr also wissen wollt, was wirklich auf der Insel passiert ist, macht euch bereit fÃ¼r einen tiefen Einblick in das Ende von Lost.

WÃ¤hrend eines GroÃŸteils der Laufzeit von Lost machten sich die Fans Sorgen, dass die Serie mit einer ""sie waren die ganze Zeit tot""-Wendung enden wÃ¼rde. SchÃ¶pfer J.J. Abrams und die beiden Showrunner Damon Lindelof und Carlton Cuse dementierten wiederholt Spekulationen, dass die Charaktere bei dem Absturz gestorben seien und die Insel eine Art Fegefeuer sei. Dennoch waren einige Zuschauer der Meinung, dass das Ende des Finales in der Kirche bestÃ¤tigte, dass sie die ganze Zeit Ã¼ber gelogen hatten und dass die gesamte Serie im Jenseits stattfand. Diese Interpretation wurde auch durch die Aufnahmen des ursprÃ¼nglichen Flugzeugabsturzes und der leeren StrÃ¤nde gestÃ¼tzt, die wÃ¤hrend des Abspannes ausgestrahlt wurden und von denen einige Fans annahmen, dass es keine Ãœberlebenden gegeben hatte.

Es stellte sich jedoch heraus, dass die Aufnahmen des Absturzes am Ende nie als Teil des eigentlichen Finales angesehen werden sollten. Stattdessen wurde es, wie ein ABC-Sprecher spÃ¤ter erklÃ¤rte, eingefÃ¼gt, damit sich die Fans, ich zitiere, ""entspannen kÃ¶nnen, bevor sie sich mit den News beschÃ¤ftigen"". Der Sender konnte sich nicht vorstellen, dass die Zuschauer dies als Teil der ErzÃ¤hlung der Serie betrachten wÃ¼rden. AuÃŸerdem bemÃ¼ht sich "" Das Ende "", ausdrÃ¼cklich klarzustellen, dass alle Ereignisse, die auf der Insel stattfanden, tatsÃ¤chlich real waren.

This channel's definitive explanation of the mysteries and mythology from the seminal TV series LOST (2004). Part Four covers the science (and pseudo-science) of the series, featuring a complete timeline on the entire history of The DHARMA Initiative including Alvar Hanso, The Valenzetti Equation, the DHARMA stations, the truce, ""The Incident"" and the purge. Plus, a dissection of how and why The Island moves; an exploration of the time travel events and their impact upon the mythology of the show; case studies on Desmond Hume and Eloise Hawking; unpicking the Man in Black's ""loophole"" and how it worked; and a full explanation of what The Numbers mean and why they matter.

The twenty-third chapter in a series of LOST EXPLAINED videos that investigate the mythology and mysteries from the seminal television series LOST. These definitive explanations are based on multiple viewings of the show over the years and careful studying of the details, clues, inconsistencies and contradictions that make up the complex tapestry of what is the greatest television show from the 2000s.

Chapter Twenty-Three lays out the likely history of the Egyptians, whose structures stand the test of time and crop up all over the island within the show. This video will explain the cork, the temple, the summoning chamber(s), the wheel, the statue, the tapestry and hieroglyphs, and the ultimate nature of the island's Egyptian civilization. We will also finally settle the debate on *when* exactly the Egyptians were on the island (was it before or after 'Across the Sea'?), but there are many questions to answer here, such as: why did they build these structures? What was their relationship to Jacob and the Man in Black? Why and how did they die out? All this and much, much more will be revealed in this video.

Were the LOST writers making up the show as they went along? This two-part video essay delves into answering that very question as thoroughly and even-handedly as possible. Part One explores the first half of the series and how Seasons 1-3 were put together, and what exactly was going on behind the scenes. The video specifically interrogates statements made by the showrunners and measures their comments against what the series actually gave us.

Lyrics below to sing along!

""Double the Family, Double the Fun!""

In a house on Maple Street, life was lookin' neat,
The Chens were cookinâ€™ dumplings, keepinâ€™ life real sweet!
But then one dayâ€”whirr!â€”came a clang and a spark,
Now robots in the basement light up after dark!

Two families, under one roof,
Wires and wokâ€”ainâ€™t that the truth!
Heart and chrome, rice and RAM,
Living together like a big olâ€™ jam!

So whether itâ€™s noodles or a motherboard run,
Itâ€™s double the family, double the fun!

A truly ground breaking, survivalist drama that changed the way we think about hour long TV Drama's.   For others, the longer the show went on the more questions they had, with zero answers.   But throughout the entire run of Lost, one episode stands out as truly game changing.  Introducing new ways of story telling, while continuing the concept of JJ Abram's Mystery Box, gave audiences a continued sense of intrigue while expanding the world even more.

VoA3kFcv818,24,,OSSA,253.0,hd,"Two decades ago, Lost redefined television and skyrocketed its cast into stardom. But where are they now, and how have their lives transformed since leaving the island?

From Jorge Garciaâ€™s musical debut on The Masked Singer to Daniel Dae Kim becoming a â€œzaddyâ€ while conquering Hollywood, these stars have had their share of twists and turns. And who could forget Josh Holloway, who swapped modeling for yoga sessions with his family, or Evangeline Lilly, who shocked fans by retiring to focus on writing and humanitarian work?

Some have kept their spotlight shiningâ€”like Dominic Monaghan, who remains fearless on stage and in wildlife adventuresâ€”while others, such as Matthew Fox, took a step back before making triumphant comebacks.

With careers spanning zombie battles (The Walking Dead spinoff, anyone?), Marvel blockbusters, and nostalgic reunions, the Lost cast proves their journey didnâ€™t end when the cameras stopped rolling.

The original broadcast tapes were often re-used by the broadcast companies to record new TV shows, so all the appearances listed in this video is lost forever, including The Rolling Stones' first ever TV appearance. 
I made this video with original photos and lots of research to match properly photo/song/date and make a good video
From a harcore stones fan to another, please enjoy!

Missing Child Expert Scott Bernstein - The Lost TV Show I serial savior

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ»ðŸ‘‰ðŸ»Follow the greatest Child Recovery Expert Scott Bernstein on a dangerous mission to find a 15-year-old boy involved with a Mexican drug cartel in California who ran away from a drug rehabilitation center in Salt Lake City Utah with the aid of these Chulo crop growers. Bernstein was viciously attacked by 40 gang bangers which were not maintained on tape as the camera crew abandoned the area during the melee. Bernstein was successful in the recovery of Christian Taylor and those responsible for hiding him. The crop farms in Mendocino & Humboldt Counties were exposed as well as an accomplice whose home was raided by a SWAT team that contained over 50 arms. He is at large.  Bernstein to date with his agency Child Recovery International has recovered over 680 missing and endangered children and over 1800 missing adults. The largest harvester of missing people in the world. If you know of someone that has a missing and endangered child, running to the police and/or MCNEC, is a huge mistake. They will NOT help you find your child. It will be an agonizing wait that will never end. Your child's life hangs in the balance. If you want to find your child, the clock is ticking. You NEED to take action and immediately. Call experts at www.thelost.net ðŸ‘ˆðŸ»ðŸ‘ˆðŸ»

RT1wD7UjXl4,24,,Silent Transmition Channel,0.0,hd,"The Lost TV Show That Only 12 People Ever Saw (And Vanished)

Some things should never be foundâ€¦ Some shows should never have aired.

A man stumbles upon an old VHS tape buried in a thrift store. No label. No markings. Just dust and a strange sense of unease. When he presses play, he expects an ordinary recording. But what he finds is something else.

The audience is motionless, their facesâ€¦ wrong. The guests fidget, as if struggling against something unseen. And the host? He smiles. Then he speaks:

""Only three left.""

No records of the program exist. No evidence of its broadcast. Yet, a list of 12 names was discoveredâ€”11 of them confirmed dead. Now, he wondersâ€¦ is he next?

6v2ka3v3q6E,28,,TechPC,0.0,hd,"Hello everyone, Swan Os is a small project, with an operating system very similar in functioning, to the internal computer of the Lost Swan station.
This operating system was created using the ReactOS framework https://reactos.org/
The purpose of this project is to try to make something more similar and surprising than the innumerable programs that simulate the functioning of the swan station computer.
I don't want to take away the credit from these programs, but the idea of an operating system that performs this task seems to me much more scenic and realistic than a program written for windows.

Obviously, as you can see from the video, the huge difference is that the timer is incorporated inside the computer, while as you will remember from the TV series, the timer was physical and hung on the wall.
Other small differences are:
1) The loading screen that anticipates the timer screen has not been shown in the TV series, however i wanted to add it because it is very scenic and pretty.
2) Beep sound, unfortunately due to some software limitations they are not exactly the same and in some computers they cannot be heard (in the video they are reproduced by my pc).

For the rest everything you see and hear is quite faithful to how it happened in the computer of the swan station, the numbers can only be entered when there are less than 4 minutes left, when there are less than 4 minutes left a beep is heard every 2 seconds, when there less than 1 minute a more aggressive beep is heard every 2 seconds, when there are less than 10 seconds left until the sequence is entered a very aggressive beep is heard every second.

When the timer expires the red hieroglyphs will appear on the timer (what you see in the video was the best i could do with a console that only shows CP437 characters) and the wording ""System Failure"" will repeatedly appear on the screen, from now on if not the lost numbers will be typed in the console within a few seconds, the computer will turn off.

As you can see from the video, the chat with Walt has also been fully implemented which will be activated by pressing the ""ESC"" button on the keyboard, located in the upper left corner.
In the chat we obviously play Michael, so we should write what Michael really wrote in the TV series to progress with the conversation. The sentences we will write may have different punctuation and/or lowercase/uppercase characters different from the original, it doesn't matter, they will work the same.

HOW TO TRY IT ON A COMPUTER?
Swan OS GitHub page: https://github.com/NikoMac10/Swan-Os
1) Download the zipped iso from the project's GitHub page
2) Extract and burn the iso image with the Rufus program on a usb stick.
3) Check the following rufus settings: partition scheme (MBR), target system (Bios(or UEFI CSM)).
4) Turn on the target computer and enter the bios and set the boot mode to (BIOS/Legacy).
5) If necessary change the boot order of the devices, and put the stick as the first boot device.
6) Enjoy the countdown ;)

If you want you can also test the iso with VMWare or virtualbox, just create the virtual machine and select the iso as boot device.

HOW TO IMPORT THE PROJECT/SOURCE CODE?
1) Do all the listed prerequisites : https://reactos.org/wiki/Building_ReactOS
2) Create a new Cosmos Kernel project on Visual Studio
3) Import the source code of Swan Os (copy and paste)
4) Download and Install VMWare for debugging.

I hope you enjoyed the project and the video, if so leave a like and subscribe.

A sample of filming locations visited from 2015 to 2019.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)

""Lost is an American drama television series that originally aired on ABC from September 22, 2004, to May 23, 2010, over six seasons, comprising a total of 121 episodes. The show contains elements of supernatural and science fiction, and follows the survivors of a commercial jet airliner flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, after the plane crashes on a mysterious island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean. The story is told in a heavily serialized manner. Episodes typically feature a primary storyline set on the island, augmented by flashback or flashforward sequences which provide additional insight into the involved characters.Lost was created by Jeffrey Lieber, J. J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, who share story writing credits for the pilot episode, which Abrams directed. Throughout the show's run, Lindelof and Carlton Cuse served as showrunners and head writers, working together with many other executive producers and writers. Due to its large ensemble cast and the cost of filming primarily on location in Oahu, Hawaii, the series was one of the most expensive on television, with the pilot alone costing over $14 million.""


Michael_Giacchino
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Giacchino

""In 2001, J. J. Abrams, producer of the television series Alias, discovered Giacchino through his video game work and asked him to provide the new show's soundtrack. The soundtrack featured a mix of full orchestral pieces frequently intermingled with upbeat electronic music, a departure from much of his previous work. Giacchino would go on to provide the score for J.J. Abrams's 2004 television series Lost.""

Fans had spent years searching for the clues that would finally reveal the truth about what was really happening on the island.  But did their relentless focus on what was happening lead them to overlook what it really meant? By unpacking the show's key themes, we can see how Lostâ€™s final season offered a deeper message about our own existenceâ€”and how while this may have disappointed or frustrated viewers who were looking for more literal answers, it was also true to the kind of story that Lost was always trying to tell. Hereâ€™s our Take on the primary conflicts of Lost, and how its ending brought them all to a thematic conclusion that revealed the universal truths at the heart of the showâ€”just like it always promised.

We have some shows that have bigger budgets than blockbuster movies, shows with extremely cinematic storytelling, and with streaming service after streaming service popping up advertising their exclusive shows, it kinda makes you forget that TV shows used to be inferior to movies. Movies used to be an experience and Tv shows were kinda just there to hold you over until the next big movie. Now, it can almost be seen as the opposite. Tv shows now are just movies with a much longer runtime. This seems to be the direction that TV shows are going to be taking from now on, but really none of this was possible without LOST.

I havenâ€™t seen anything quite like it since, though the TV show â€“ From,  has used many similar themes.  Lost and Game of Thrones Director Jack Bender is also involved with From.
As with all long running TV shows, Lost can be a little slow at times, involving itself with back stories and character development, but it really is worth getting to know the characters and their motivations.
