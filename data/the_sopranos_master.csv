New Line Cinema’s “The Many Saints of Newark” is the much-anticipated feature film prequel to David Chase’s groundbreaking, award-winning HBO drama series “The Sopranos.”
 
Young Anthony Soprano is growing up in one of the most tumultuous eras in Newark’s history, becoming a man just as rival gangsters begin to rise up and challenge the all-powerful DiMeo crime family’s hold over the increasingly race-torn city. Caught up in the changing times is the uncle he idolizes, Dickie Moltisanti, who struggles to manage both his professional and personal responsibilities—and whose influence over his nephew will help make the impressionable teenager into the all-powerful mob boss we’ll later come to know: Tony Soprano.
 
“The Many Saints of Newark” stars Alessandro Nivola (“Disobedience,” “American Hustle”), Tony winner Leslie Odom Jr. (Broadway’s “Hamilton,” “Murder on the Orient Express”), Jon Bernthal (“Baby Driver,” “The Wolf of Wall Street”), Corey Stoll (“First Man,” “Ant-Man”), Michael Gandolfini (TV’s “The Deuce”), Billy Magnussen (“Game Night,” “The Big Short”), Michela De Rossi (“Boys Cry,” TV’s “The Rats”), John Magaro (“The Finest Hours,” “Not Fade Away”), with Emmy winner Ray Liotta (TV’s “Shades of Blue,” “Goodfellas”) and Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga (“Up in the Air,” “The Conjuring” films).
 
Alan Taylor (“Thor: The Dark World”), who won an Emmy for his directing work on “The Sopranos,” is helming the film from a screenplay by series creator David Chase & Lawrence Konner, based on characters created by Chase.  Chase, Konner and Nicole Lambert are producing the film, with Michael Disco, Marcus Viscidi, Toby Emmerich and Richard Brener serving as executive producers.
 
Taylor’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Kramer Morgenthau (“Creed II,” “Thor: The Dark World”), production designer Bob Shaw (“The Wolf of Wall Street,” “The Sopranos”), Oscar-nominated editor Christopher Tellefsen (“Moneyball,” “A Quiet Place”) and costume designer Amy Westcott (“The Wrestler,” “Black Swan”).
 
“The Many Saints of Newark” was shot on location in New Jersey and New York, and several beloved characters from the original series that inspired the film are featured in the movie. During its six-season run, “The Sopranos”—widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential television drama series of all time—was honored with 21 Primetime Emmy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, and two Peabody Awards, to name only a portion.
 
New Line Cinema Presents, In Association with Home Box Office, a Chase Films Production, “The Many Saints of Newark.” The film is slated for release in theaters nationwide on October 1, 2021 and will be available in the U.S. on HBO Max for 31 days from theatrical release. It is being distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and has been rated R for strong violence, pervasive language, sexual content and some nudity.","Alan Taylor,Alessandro Nivola,Billy Magnussen,Coming Soon,Corey Stoll,Crime,Crime Drama,Criminal,Drama,Film,Film Trailer,Film Warner,Giovanni Soprano,Jon Bernthal,Leslie Odom Jr,Many Saints of Newark,Michael Gandolfini,Mobster,Movie,Official Trailer,Prequel,The Sopranos,Tony Soprano,Trailer,Trailer 2021,Vera Farmiga,WB,Warner,Warner Bros,Warner Brothers,Warner Media",1,11744654,68344,8641,PT2M23S,hd,public

But what some may not know is that Tony Sirico’s background is closely similar to his portrayed character. Before Sopranos Sirico was a gangster associated with the Colombo family. In this video we dive deeper into Sirico’s past and how it influenced his appearances in Sopranos, Goodfellas, Miami Vice and Godfather 2.

Sometimes it's good to come back here, and watch his greatest scenes over and over again. He was a very talented and fascinating actor. I hope these videos help to keep his memory 
alive.

Binging with Babish: Ziti and Lasagna from The Sopranos,c_BGPTK3GQk,Binging with Babish,UCJHA_jMfCvEnv-3kRjTCQXw,2019-09-17T13:00:11Z,"Rarely does food play such a central character in a TV show or movie that's not specifically about food, but in The Sopranos, it might as well be one of the family.  The crown jewel of which, despite Artie Bucco's hapless attempts, is the cuisine of Carmela Soprano.  Strap on your gold President and build a ramp for the ducks, because it's time to emotionally repress our murderous mentality with some cheesy, saucy pasta - with a layer of basil underneath the cheese, of course.

The Most Devastating Deaths On The Sopranos,isJRRqtyz_U,Looper,UCP1iRaFlS5EYjJBryFV9JPw,2022-02-09T03:00:11Z,"Hailed as one of the greatest television shows of all time, The Sopranos spent six seasons delving into the world of organized crime in New Jersey. The series launched the careers of a number of actors and not only put HBO on the map, but proved that television could truly compete with film as an artistic medium.
Violence on the show wasn’t pretty, and no one was safe from it. And as we all know, TV greatness can never be achieved without the death of at least a few characters we know and love — or love to hate. Let's take a look at the most devastating deaths on The Sopranos.

WARNINGS: Violence, disturbing images and SPOILERS to the whole show.

""They say that sometimes we go around feeling pity for ourselves. But behind our back a great wind is carrying us"".

I finished watching this wonderful show last night, and my god, I already miss it. Truly a magnificent show, it became one of my favorites so quickly. 
Tony Soprano is my favorite character from the show, and Chrissy is right after him, so it's pretty obvious why I used so many scenes of these two.

I orignally started working on this project when I first started the show, back then I still used Sony Vegas, but then I decided to take a break from the video for a few seasons, but around season 4 I got back to it again, and I edited this while I was watching. I believe my next Sopranos video will be a bit better than this one.

If you still haven't watched this AMAZING show, I highly recommend you to start right now aha

I'd like to thank Nadiow for being my inspiration while making this video, please check out his Christopher Moltisanti video, I watch it non stop for a few months now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4VUgAjJZRo

Another video that inspired me so much to use this song, is a collab between two of my favorite editors. Thank you, Artem and Zurik:

""Christopher"" is the 42nd episode of the HBO original series The Sopranos and the third episode of the show's fourth season. It's teleplay was written by Michael Imperioli, from a story idea by Imperioli and Maria Laurino. It was directed by Tim Van Patten and originally aired on September 29, 2002.

Silvio wants to take action against Native Americans protesting the Columbus Day parade, believing their actions to be insulting to Italian-Americans. When, without Tony's approval, he, Patsy, and Artie attempt to break up the protest, Little Paulie and several others are injured. Ralphie threatens the protest leader, Professor Del Redclay, that he will make it known that Iron Eyes Cody, a popular Native American figure, was actually an Italian-American. Tony unsuccessfully appeals to Assemblyman Ron Zellman and to an Indian chief to convince Redclay to cancel the protest. The chief invites Tony and his crew to his casino. Both the parade and protest occur without mob intervention, which upsets Silvio. Tony forcefully argues to Silvio that his achievements came through his own abilities, not through his heritage, and scorns the idea that everyone belongs to a victimized group.","Tony Soprano,Sopranos,mafia,mob boss,wise guy,Italian-American,TV series,organized crime,The Sopranos,HBO,Italian-American culture,violence,James Gandolfini,New Jersey,crime family,Christopher Moltisanti,Michael Imperioli,David Chase,Furio Giunta,Federico Castelluccio,Christopher,Maria Laurino,Columbus Day,Native Americans,protest,Silvio Dante,Steven van Zandt,Ralph Cifaretto,Joe Pantoliano,Joey Pants,discrimination,victimized,public holiday,Vito",1,3148212,129043,4117,PT53S,hd,public

HBO’s The Sopranos follows the trials and tribulations of New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano. The show contains a wide variety of interesting characters with depth and nuance, from Christopher Moltisanti, Janice Soprano, Ritchie April, Ralph Cifaretto,  Johnny Sack and much much more.

Many of the supporting characters of the shows are now legendary and iconic, and there is perhaps no character more beloved to Sopranos fans than Bobby Baccalieri, better known as Bobby Bacala, played by Steve Schiripa. First appearing in ‘Do Not Resuscitate’, the 2nd episode of the second season of the show, Bobby has gone onto become perhaps the most loved character in the entire series. He’s a big guy, but he’s got a big heart, he’s shy, naïve, and thoughtful. He’s a little dub, which makes him endearing, and he gets made fun of a lot in the show and is something of a pushover. He also formed a dynamic duo with Junior Soprano, the two characters sharing excellent chemistry and playing off one another in entertaining fashion. This “aw shucks” attitude of the character sticks out in a bizarre way but lovable way, given how Bobby is surrounded by vicious sociopaths and bloodthirsty killers. This gentle giant has won the hearts of Sopranos fans everywhere, with notable reasons being his love for his children and his faithfulness to his wife Karen, the fact that he as a grown man in the mob played with trains, and his tragic death, which came via a mob execution as part of a mob war which Bobby thought was over, but he had been misinformed. Bobby is remembered by fans of the show as a lovable big goof, the only decent guy out of the main characters in the show, one who only truly became unshakably angry when the lives of his children were in danger.  

Today however, I wanted to offer an alternate take, one that will perhaps be controversial for Sopranos fans.

In the 11th episode of the fourth season of ""The Sopranos"", Camen and Johnny demanded to get from H.U.D. In the scam, he got 40% of the profits but was rejected by Tony. Cameron even sent someone to beat Tony's appraiser. In a fit of rage, Tony went to Miami to negotiate with Camain Jr., who promised to resolve the matter. In New Jersey, Clado's claim of ""mental incapacity for civil conduct"" was rejected by the judge, and the trial continued. Bobby was deeply saddened by the loss of his wife, and Janice tried her best to console him. Furthermore, after meeting Jennifer, Tony realized that four years of psychotherapy had alleviated his despair and panic.",,22,1793528,48402,692,PT57S,hd,public

In the fourth episode of the first season of ""The Sopranos"", Tony encounters a problem when dealing with gang affairs: the old-fashioned gang member Herman refuses to cooperate in collecting protection money and even colludes with others to resist Tony's arrangement. Tony has no choice but to apply both soft and hard pressure. Meanwhile, his psychotherapy was still ongoing. Jennifer guided him to face up to his complex emotions towards his father - both admiring his authority and being dissatisfied with his neglect of the family. In terms of family, Camilla discovered that Tony had secretly given money to his mother, Livia. The two had an argument because of Livia's ""double-sided behavior"". Medeline turned to Tony for help with her dance partner at the school dance. The pressure from the gang, family conflicts and inner struggles interwove, plunging Tony into anxiety once again and further revealing the rift between his identities as a ""gang leader"" and an ""ordinary family member"". #shorts #tv#fyp #besttvshow#watchnow #bingewatch #youtubeshorts#thesopranos #carimedrama #sopranos #trendingshorts#shorts#vrial#viralvideo #mustwatch  #thesopranos2025 #clips",,22,1817735,42136,224,PT1M,hd,public

"The First and Last Lines Spoken by The Sopranos Characters (130+ characters, pt. 1 & 2 complete)",O3bEPZ4mTlc,Bern,UCXNXiCedB-FVaCJRvFvV4LQ,2023-09-07T17:12:12Z,"Methodology:

1. I focused on characters that made 3-or-more episode appearances. Some characters included only made 2. A handful that made 3 were not included. Kids were not included. I included George Pagileri, a single episode character, at the end because it made for a better finale.

2. I focused on first and last lines, not scenes. Tony Blundetto doesn’t say anything before Tony Soprano shoots him so that is not his “last line.”

3. I considered a line to be any word of spoken dialogue that was probably written as dialogue (as opposed to being written as an action line, in terms of the teleplay). For this reason, Tony’s initial “yeah” and Meadow’s final “shit” were included. However, the struggling noises that Eugene makes when he is hanging is probably written as an action line. Similarly, Jason Gervasi’s “alright” in “Chasing it” happens technically before the “envelopes” line to Tony in the video but it didn’t appear to be written specifically as dialogue to me. Similarly, Beansie, greets a customer before the line included in the vid but again, appeared incidental. I did though consider Paulie’s “Ooo” to be written specific to his character which is why that was included. One final example is even though Rhiannon Flamer is seen laughing, watching TV with AJ after the line included in the video, I again considered that that was probably written as “Rhiannon laughs” and not “RHIANNON: Hahahah”. In general, I used my own discretion.

4. I opted to include the two different actors in the pilot who played Father Phil and Irina but did not do this for any other actor changes throughout the series, for example, Joanne Moltisanti, Quintina Blundetto etc.

5. Adrian La Cerva was retroactively determined to be “Adrianna” in the pilot by the writers after it aired. I believe Chris’s line, heard in the video as Adrianna answers the door, is meant to allude to this and she is also listed in the credits as such. I’ve included both scenes though.

6. Anthony Infante technically says the “cheers” line with Bing guys after the “for the best” line included in the vid but since it was a group saying it together and for timing, I didn’t include it.

7. It’s possible Tom Giglione says an ADR/off-screen line after the “Yeats” line included in the vid, but I prefer the Yeats line in any case.

8. You could say Furio’s last line was the answering machine message when Carmela calls him but I didn’t consider that to be the case.

9. I didn’t consider Flashbacks or Dreams when it comes to “first lines” or ""last lines"", in other words, Jackie Aprile Sr, Livia Soprano, Corrado Soprano Jr., and others, first lines are when they are heard within the general timeframe of the show and not during flashbacks. 

10. Technically, Billy Leotardo’s last line is delivered via Flashback from Phil Leotardo but since it was within the general timeframe of the show I’ve included it.

11. You could argue that Vito’s last line is when he is in the car talking to Tony but I distinctly hear a “no”, although come to think of it that was probably written as an action line in the script, oh well, it’s staying.

12. I did not include the Olivia Soprano CGI scene, and I don’t think Chase should have either.",,24,931480,11370,792,PT40M7S,hd,public

His body and memory have not yet fully recovered, and he feels strange about his surroundings. Camilla takes good care of him by his side but can't hide her worry. Meanwhile, the gang was leaderless. Paul ie and Cillian were engaged in a covert struggle for temporary control, and business disputes followed one after another. Christopher tried to steady the situation but was unable to do so. In addition, Tony's dreams frequently feature symbolic signs, reflecting his confusion about power and self. This episode takes Tony's difficult recovery as the thread, interwoven with the dual turmoil of his family and gang.

In the fourth episode of the fifth season of ""The Sopranos"", the power struggle between Johnny Sacker and Camain Jr. escalates. Lorraine and Jason are executed by Phil. Milo urges Camain Jr. to confront him head-on, while Angelo urges him to be patient. In New Jersey, Mitchel, a veteran gang member who has just been released from prison, disregarded Tony's authority. Not only did he fob off the casino management work he arranged, but he also sold the stolen luxury car to Johnny instead of his own gang. Tony didn't want to repeat Richie's mistake and ingeniously set up a trap to make Mitchel violate the parole regulations and return to prison. At the same time, Camilla confessed to the school advisor that she was extremely worried that her son Anthony would fail to get into college and follow in Tony's footsteps, and she was filled with fear.

In the 11th episode of the 5th season of ""The Sopranos"", Tony is under double pressure: on the one hand, the New York gang forces are trying to interfere in the garbage disposal business in New Jersey, and he needs to negotiate hard to hold his ground. However, due to his deputy Bobby's lack of experience, the negotiation process often gets stuck. On the other hand, his daughter Medeline was embroiled in an alcohol scandal at college. Tony wanted to settle it with money, but was opposed by his wife Camilla, and a fierce argument broke out between the couple. Meanwhile, Christopher lost control again due to the drug problem and almost leaked the gang's secrets. Although Tony, out of consideration for the past, did not punish him severely, he secretly weakened his power. At the end of this episode, Tony smokes alone in the office. Facing the crisis of the family business and the rift in family relations, it fully reveals the loneliness and powerlessness of the gang boss, laying the groundwork for the subsequent conflict. #besttvshow#crimedrama",,22,1442755,54995,546,PT58S,hd,public

The Sopranos ending explained. Who killed Tony Soprano? Who shot Tony Soprano? What happened at the end of The Sopranos? Did Tony Soprano die? 

In the final scene of The Sopranos, Tony arrives at Holsteins for a mean with his family, and selects Journey’s Don’t Stop Believing from the joke box console at his table. One after the other, Carmella and AJ arrive, with Meadow outside struggling to park her car. They eat, engage in small talk, and just as Meadow reaches the diner door, Tony looks up, and we cut to black. And so ends one of the most infamous endings to any TV show, one that has infuriated fans, leading many to think something was wrong with their TV when they first watched it. It is a hotly debated topic, even today decades later, as to what actually happened, with many fans thinking Tony was shot dead in that moment.

In this video, I wanted to explore the possibility of Tony having died, and in particular, running down a list of suspects of who could have wanted him dead and carrying it out.","the sopranos,tony soprano,who killed tony soprano,what happened at the end of the sopranos,the sopranos ending explained,the sopranos final scene,did tony soprano die",1,741698,13471,3139,PT17M42S,hd,public

In HBO’s classic mob drama The Sopranos, we follow New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano and his attempt to survive the treacherous world of the mafia, the long arm of the law, and the headache-inducing world of family life.

In the series’ final episode, “Made in America”, a sit down is arranged between Tony and Paulie, representing the DiMeos, and Butch and Albie Cianfalone, representing the Lupertazzis. Butch expresses his dissatisfaction with Phil’s leadership and agrees to a ceasefire. He does not reveal Phil’s location, but agrees not to get in the way, and eventually, Phil is shot and killed at a gas station in front of his wife and grandchildren, and his head is crushed by his own SUV for good measure.

The reasons are pretty obvious, and I’ll get to them, but in this video I wanted to analysis things a bit further, to go a bit deeper into the relationship between Christopher and Tony and come to a comprehensive conclusion as to why killing Christopher was an essential part of Tony’s grown, one that sealed his transformation into the man he became, a transformation which you could argue started with his killing of his close friend in season 2.

The Sopranos Season 6, Episode 4 hides the cruelty of the ""mafia"" in the trivialities of daily life, laying out crises with almost plain shots. Tony seems to handle family affairs as usual, but his quarrels with his men and calculations about business are all hidden beneath the dialogue. There are no intense conflicts, yet everywhere there is an oppression of loosening power.
Carmela's struggle between family and morality is more realistic. Her avoidance of Tony's career and the violence she accidentally witnesses form a disconnect, grounding the character's sense of contradiction. This episode does not rely on a strong plot, but accumulates tension through life fragments - the silence over a glass of wine, averted eyes for a moment - all hinting at the coming storm, which accurately fits the show's unique style of ""deconstructing the mafia through daily life"".

In the 9th episode of the 5th season of ""The Sopranos"", Tony Soprano notices that his cousin Tony Bredeto is limping when walking. Bredeto claims to have been attacked by a black man. Later, when Tony and Johnny Saccgolf learned that there was a witness of the lame murderer at the scene of Joe Pippes' death. He questioned Bredeto but was denied. Feeling guilty about Bredeto's imprisonment, Tony chose to keep it a secret and gave him the management rights of the casino, which aroused Christopher's dissatisfaction. Meanwhile, Camilla initiated the divorce process, but due to Tony's influence, she couldn't find a lawyer willing to take over or an accountant daring to investigate her finances. Tony's deep-seated guilt towards Bredeto was also unearthed during his psychotherapy.#thesopranos #shorts #youtubeshorts #carimedrama #sopranos #trendingshorts  #shorts #vrial #viralvideo  #watchnow  #bingewatch  #mustwatch  #thesopranos2025 #clips #tv #fyp #besttvshow#crimedrama",,22,987325,45146,275,PT1M,hd,public

This time it's the pepper and egg sandwich that junior regretted not having. The man is full of regrets and this sandwich might be his deepest one. This is a simple sandwich but perfect in every way. The sandwich originated in Chicago where it was served out of Italian Beef shops during lent when Fridays were meatless. For me, this is an all year round sandwich, it is just too good!

The season 5 finale centers on ""revenge, choice, and mafia balance"": Phil from the New York mafia, grieving over his brother Billy’s death, vows to torture Tony’s cousin Blundetto for revenge. This stalemates business between the New Jersey and New York mafias, forcing Christopher into hiding. To find Blundetto, Phil beats Tony’s associate Benny severely, leaving him critically injured—this finally shakes Tony. Influenced by his therapist, Tony decides to confront his guilt and ultimately kills Blundetto himself to defuse the conflict. Later, Tony reconciles with Johnny Sack of the New York mafia, but Johnny is arrested on the spot during a police raid. Tony escapes through the woods, and after confirming the police are only targeting the New York mafia, he walks home through the snow.#thesopranos #shorts #youtubeshorts #carimedrama #sopranos #trendingshorts  #shorts #vrial #viralvideo  #watchnow  #bingewatch  #mustwatch  #thesopranos2025 #clips #tv #fyp#besttvshow#crimedrama",,22,820476,24459,257,PT1M,hd,public

😭 The Sopranos Actors Who Tragically Passed Away

What if the characters we loved on The Sopranos weren’t just gone from our screens—but from real life too? These iconic actors shaped one of the most groundbreaking shows in television history. But behind the legendary roles, their stories came to an end far too soon. 

From untimely tragedies to lives lived fully but cut short, we’re about to pay tribute to the stars of The Sopranos who have left us: some at a ripe old age, and others far too soon, in their 40s. 

Get ready as we celebrate the lives and legacies of the Sopranos actors we’ve lost  and will remember.

Tony Soprano, Silvio, Carmine, and Johnny Sack meet for a high-stakes sit-down while Uncle Junior listens on an untraceable call. Carmine refuses the request to take out Ralph Cifaretto, and Johnny demands revenge for the infamous “mole joke.”

Watch as Tony presses Johnny—“Who told you it was Ralph?”—but Johnny keeps Paulie’s name secret, hinting at the old days: “We bend more rules than the Catholic Church.”

This is the mob drama at its finest—power, loyalty, and a war that almost erupted between the families.

With suppression as the shell and cracks as the core - the cold and stern metaphor of the revenge scene in ""The Sophors"" S6. After Tony is attacked by his uncle, his son Anthony's urge for revenge is forcibly suppressed. This scene tears off the warm mask of the gangster family. Anthony's anger was originally a blood instinct, but it was suppressed by Tony with the idea of ""considering the overall situation"" - seemingly a father protecting his son and maintaining stability, but in fact, it exposed the instrumental nature of family ties in the gangster world: when emotions threaten the power order, even the most natural blood ties have to give way to the calculation of interests. Tony's intervention failed to resolve the conflict; instead, it only deepened the rift. It implies that the trust within the family has collapsed and also sets the stage for the turmoil in the power structure in the subsequent plot, which is chilling and terrifying.

Lyrics:

I woke up this morning
Got myself a gun
Mama always said I'd be the
Chosen One

One in a million
I've got live burn to shine
I was born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in my eyes

And I
Woke up this morning
And all that love had gone
Papa never told me
About right and wrong

But I´m looking good, baby
I believe that I´m feeling fine
I was born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in my eyes
So help me now

Woke up this morning
I got a blue moon in my eyes
Woke up this morning
I got a blue moon in my eyes

I woke up this morning
The world turned upside down
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same
Since the Blues walked in our town

But I´m one in a million
Cause I´ve got that shotgun shine; shame about it
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in my eyes

Woke up this morning
I got a blue moon in my eyes 
Woke up this morning
I got a blue moon in my eyes

I can´t help myself

I woke up this morning everything was gone
By half past ten my head was going ding-dong
Ringing like a bell from my head down to my toes
Like a voice telling me there was something I should know
Last night I was flying but today I´m so low
Ain't it times like these make me wonder if I'll ever know
The meaning of things as they appear to the others:
Wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers
I wish I didn't function
And I wish I didn't think
Beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink'
Well I do so make up my mind to go on, cause
When I woke up this morning everything I had was gone

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Got myself a gun

Cause I can't help myself, yeah

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning
Got myself a gun
Got myself a gun
Got myself a gun

He is Tony Soprano's maternal cousin who served 16 years in prison on hijacking charges before being released in 2004 and trying to go legitimate and starting a career as a massage therapist, but finds himself returning back to his life of crime, leading him into a spiral of destruction that damages the Soprano family's business relationship with the Lupertazzi family. Eventually, Tony B is taken out by Tony Soprano. He is portrayed by Steve Buscemi.

In today's video, I want to make the controversial argument that Tony Blundetto is actually a poorly written and poorly acted character. In fact, from the main cast of The Sopranos, Tony B is the worst character in the show.","the sopranos,the sopranos tony b,the sopranos tony soprano and tony blundetto,tony blundetto,steve buscemi",1,166495,4161,1477,PT13M53S,hd,public

In this video, I break down how Tony Soprano could actually afford his house — one of the most iconic homes in TV history. From his mob earnings to his “legitimate” income streams, I’ll take a closer look at the financial reality behind Tony’s lifestyle and what it reveals about The Sopranos’ portrayal of wealth, power, and the American Dream.

We’ll look at what the house would really cost, what Tony’s income might have been, and how his money flowed between the mob, his family, and his image as a suburban kingpin.

👉 Do you think Tony could really afford that house? Let me know your thoughts in the comments!

Dizinin başrol oyuncusu James Gandolfini; bir röportajında, gerçek hayattaki mafya üyeleri tarafından sık sık arandığını, dizinin gerçekçiliği konusunda kendisine iltifat ettiklerini ve tavsiyelerde bulunduklarını söylüyor.

Bunun en büyük örneklerinden birisi dizinin pilot bölümünde Tony, evindeki barbekü partisinde şort giyer. 
Bölümün yayınlanmasından sonra gerçek hayattan bir mafya üyesi Gandolfini'ye bir daha asla şort giymemesini söylemiş ve dizi ekibi bu konuşmayı yıllar sonra senaryoya da ekliyorlar. Dördüncü sezonun birinci bölümünde New York'lu mafya babası Carmine, Tony'ye: ""Bir 'BABA'  şort giymez."" diyerek bu olaya atıfta bulunurlar.

The Sopranos Season Four Tier List | Ranked and Reviewed,TePs4wSpDGI,Beat Rice,UCnsPOf76CGzq4d1GlgoDZYA,2025-10-17T22:00:26Z,"Is it that time again already?? That's right, it's time to cover season four of The Sopranos! This season is much more of a mixed bag this time around, containing both the worst episode of the show, one of the best episodes in television history, and a whole lot more in between. Which episodes will end up on top? Will YOUR favorite episodes make it to S tier, or even, gulp, SS tier? And is ""Christopher"" really as bad as everyone says it is? (Yes. It absolutely is.) If any of my takes made YOU angry, let me know in the comments below! Thank you all very much for watching, and I hope you thouroughly enjoy. Take care!

The Lupertazzi Family
A major New York crime family, wealthier, larger, and more politically connected. They’re portrayed as more “corporate” and structured, with layers of leadership and business interests that extend far beyond the street-level rackets. Their internal politics, however, are often brutal and treacherous.

The Soprano Family (DiMeo Family)
A smaller New Jersey crew with less influence and fewer resources. Tony’s crew is more personal, volatile, and tightly knit, with conflicts that arise from loyalty issues, family dynamics, and Tony’s own leadership style. They often feel overshadowed by New York and rely on negotiating power rather than dominance.","The Sopranos,Lupertazzi family,Tony Soprano,Johnny Sack,Carmine Lupertazzi,Sopranos analysis,Sopranos comparison,New York crime family,New Jersey mob,Sopranos families,Mafia families,Sopranos explained,Lupertazzi vs Soprano,Sopranos lore,HBO Sopranos",22,43198,813,179,PT13M9S,hd,public

The Sopranos 2x01 “Guy Walks Into a Psychiatrist’s Office…” | First Time Reaction,nckYjqVrsRM,Diegesis,UCmvxowUSpLTANa7tdqGrxwA,2025-11-18T19:00:06Z,"Patreon for Watch Alongs and Early Access: https://www.patreon.com/diegesisTV

Arianna and Maple kick off The Sopranos Season 2 with “Guy Walks Into a Psychiatrist’s Office…” — a sharp, introspective, and explosive return to Tony’s world of crime, therapy, and family chaos.

Tony’s on top after Uncle Junior’s arrest — but power only makes things more complicated. As he takes control of the family business, new threats rise in unexpected places: Richie Aprile returns from prison with a grudge, Livia’s manipulations still linger, and Tony’s stress sends him right back to Dr. Melfi’s office (whether he likes it or not). Meanwhile, the FBI begins to close in, setting up a season built on paranoia, loyalty, and betrayal.

With humor, violence, and emotional depth, The Sopranos proves again why it changed TV forever — balancing mob drama with the raw humanity behind it.

Benny Fazio is a low-level soldier in the DiMeo crime family on *The Sopranos*, portrayed by Max Casella. He starts out as an associate working under Christopher Moltisanti and later becomes a made man. Benny is loyal but hot-headed, often getting caught up in petty feuds and violent errands. He represents the younger, street-level side of the mob, ambitious, reckless, and eager to prove himself.","Benny Fazio,The Sopranos,Benny Fazio Sopranos,Max Casella,Sopranos characters,DiMeo crime family,Christopher Moltisanti,Sopranos clips,Sopranos scene,Sopranos analysis,The Sopranos HBO,Sopranos mob,Sopranos soldiers,Benny Fazio scenes,Benny Fazio moments,Sopranos mafia,Sopranos review,Sopranos tribute,The Sopranos character analysis,Sopranos highlights",22,19329,491,159,PT12M57S,hd,public
