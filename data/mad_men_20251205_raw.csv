The Real Don Draper From 'Mad Men'?,fnqBe2sWbHc,VICE,UCn8zNIfYAQNdrFRrr8oibKw,2015-02-23T18:17:16Z,"Don Draper is a character that could only exist in fiction: impossibly handsome, endlessly talented, and crippled by alcoholism and other impulse-control problems. VICE was curious to see if there was any truth behind Mad Men protagonist, and that's how we found George Lois.

A leader of the Creative Revolution, Lois helped create the campaign ""I Want My MTV,"" and make companies like Xerox, Jiffy Lube, and Tommy Hilfiger household names. He also designed 92 iconic covers for Esquire. Lois is often referred to as an inspiration for Don Draper, but there are stark differences between the two. Here's his story.

In many ways, the Jon Hamm character is the American ideal that everyone aspires to be, but nobody really is. In the ending of the series, Don appears to finally have learned how to bridge his past and his present. But how did he arrive at this point, ready to create the iconic Hilltop Coca-Cola ad?

He was anything but heroic, and many expected his death to be the ending of the show, but that isn’t how Mad Men decided to wrap things up.

Don got to his breaking point after realizing some things about himself, but he ultimately found peace in the final moments of the show and even dreamed up one of the most famous ads of all time. Let’s take a look at the explanation of the ending of Mad Men.

It's been 10 years since TV show Mad Men first waltzed onto our TV screens. The cast of this show was incredible! But where are they now? Are they on a break from the pressures of a hit TV show or have they gone on to take on bigger projects? Find the answer in our video 'Mad Men cast: Where are they now?' 

The role of Peggy Olson has brought the actress Elizabeth Moss six Emmy Awards nominations and a Golden Globe nomination. But where is she now? Does she has a family? When the actor John Slattery was done portraying Roger Sterling. he had no problem finding his next project. He made an appearance in the Netflix show Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp. Nobody can't. If you see Christina Hendricks as Joan Harris you will never forget her! And now you have an opportunity to see her on the new series Good Girls. Did you know that Vincent Kartheiser, who played the role of Pete Campbell, met his future wife Alexis Bledel on set of Mad Men? The actress January Jones aka Betty Francis now is playing on The Last Man on Earth. And you can find another wife of Don Draper, Jessica Paré on the set of the show SEAL Team along with David Boreanazas. But we will always remember Megan Draper and her song Zou Bisou Bisou. And what about Jon Hamm? Where is he now? Find the answer in our video!

I first watched this series back when it aired, and revisiting it was a real joy. It still holds up very well, though parts of it do hit a bit different over 15 years later. This is my first foray into such a dense series, and I hope you all enjoy it.

Участника Mad Men задержали за изготовление и сбыт наркотиков,EE_5rHaJGYI,Информбюро 31,UCKJIfb3BN2x14J4U30wzLeA,2021-04-22T16:40:38Z,"Участников популярной среди казахстанской молодежи Q-роp группы Mad Men задержали за изготовление и сбыт наркотиков. Полиция Алматы провела большую спецоперацию. Кадры с задержанием опубликовали в сети. И поклоники бойз-бенда сразу же узнали на оперативном видео своих кумиров. А именно солиста и продюсера группы. 
– Поедем показывать коробки, в которых, предположительно, находятся средства для того, чтобы синтезировать наркотические вещества, переданные мне Русланом Хваном. Данные коробки находятся в поселке Рахат. В сарае у моего отца. 
В полиции Алматы распространили кадры задержания преступной группы из десяти человек. Они изготавливали и продавали наркотики. На кадрах поклонники узнали двух участников популярной Q-pop группы Mad Мen. Это солист бойз-бенда Moora и их продюсер Руслан Хван. 
ЕРЛАН АЛМАГАМБЕТОВ, начальник Управления по противодействию наркопреступности ДП Алматы:
– Группа Mad Мen, насколько я знаю. Где они по месту работы обысковые работы произвели, ничего противозаконного не нашли. Изъятие произвели в Наурызбайском и Алатауском районе. Они через телеграм-каналы продавали закладки, отправляли. Закладчики тоже задержаны. 
По версии следствия, преступная группа действовала по отлаженной схеме. Три человека отвечали за поставку компонентов для изготовления синтетических наркотиков из России. Еще двое – так называемые ""кассиры"" – принимали заявки и работали с закладчиками. Их было четверо. И промышляли они зачастую в Наурызбайском, Бостандыкском и Алатауском районах Алматы.
Mad Мen дебютировал четыре года назад. Их песни и клипы набирают миллионы прослушиваний. Создал бойз-бенд и продюсерский центр MM Entertainment Руслан Хван. Они продвигают другую группу Crystalz, организовывают молодежные кастинги, музыкальные мероприятия и даже создали свою танцевальную студию.
АРДАК КАМАЛ, корреспондент:
– Здесь, в подвале многоэтажного дома представители MM Entertainment, куда входит и группа Mad Мen, проводили занятия по танцам. Посетители несколько раз видели здесь продюсера и членов бойз-бенда. На камеру они говорить отказались, однако уверяют, что ничего подозрительного внутри не происходило, и о продаже наркотиков не знали. Сейчас центр закрыт. 
Задержанным членам ОПГ от 21 до 30 лет. Руководил преступной группой 27-летний гражданин.  Сейчас они в изоляторе временного содержания. Свою вину признают. Тиктокерша Лора еще летом заявляла в соцсети о причастности артистов к наркотикам: 
– Учитывая, что они их юзали, у меня есть пруфы на это, их можно посадить. Танцевальная студия тире наркопритон. Там и мэды, и их продюсер, там и участники ММ-хауса. 
Стражи порядка признают, что некоторые члены преступной банды и сами принимали наркотики.  Однако добавляют, что почти год следили за их преступной деятельностью и поймали всех причастных. По статье «Незаконные изготовление, переработка и сбыт наркотических средств в группе лиц» задержанным грозит лишение свободы от пяти до десяти лет с конфискацией имущества.

However, despite its large cast of characters, there was only one actor who starred in every single episode of those seven seasons. That actor? Jon Hamm, who played the lead character Don Draper to critical acclaim. However, one character was played by a total of eight actors over the course of the show. Bobby Draper, Don Draper’s son was only a small boy in Season One, so as he grew up he would need to be played by different actors. It was even hard to keep up with the change in actors according to Kiernan Shipka, who played Sally Draper, so she gave the actors nicknames such as Pillow Face Bobby and Slurpee Bobby.

Задержание участников Q-pop группы Mad Men. Оперативное видео,eYkNgzmxLNQ,TENGRI TV,UCaVwOq2dw-_pghudWqMdalA,2021-04-22T13:28:04Z,"Участники популярной Q-pop группы Mad Men оказались в числе тех, кого накануне задержала полиция Алматы по подозрению в наркопреступлении, передает корреспондент Tengrinews.kz.

В задержанных пользователи Сети узнали Moora и продюсера Mad Men Руслана Хвана.
Они подозреваются в изготовлении и сбыте наркотиков в составе обширной наркогруппы.
В ее составе 10 молодых людей в возрасте от 21 года до 30 лет. Руководил группой – гражданин Х., 1994 года рождения. 

""В поле зрения бойцов Управления по противодействию наркопреступности гражданин Х. попал в сентябре 2020 года. Согласно имеющимся оперативным данным, мужчина в составе группы уже несколько месяцев занимался в Алматы изготовлением и сбытом синтетических наркотиков. Преступная деятельность гражданина Х. и его “помощников” была официально задокументирована. Роли каждого его ассистента были четко распределены. К примеру, три человека, одна из которых – девушка, отвечали за поставку компонентов для изготовления синтетических наркотиков из Российской Федерации посредством логистической компании, двое молодых людей – так называемые кассиры, отвечали за прием заявок и работу с закладчиками, еще четверо мужчин – и есть те самые закладчики наркотиков, которые орудовали зачастую в Наурызбайском, Бостандыкском и Алатауском районах города"", – сообщил заместитель начальника Департамента полиции города Алматы Берик Абильбеков.

What is happiness? Advertising is centered around analyzing that very question and exploiting consumers for their personal yearnings. Mad Men's Don Draper is an icon for his womanizing and insight into human psychology. Don Draper can sell anything to anyone. But why?
In this video, I explain AMC's hit series Mad Men and how their characters function.

La serie, ambientata nella New York degli anni sessanta, tratta della vita di alcuni pubblicitari che lavorano per l'agenzia Sterling Cooper di Madison Avenue e si concentra sul dirigente e creativo Don Draper. 
Il telefilm ritrae i cambiamenti sociali in atto negli Stati Uniti in quel particolare contesto storico.

""Quegli anni mi interessano perché ci dicono tante cose su quello che sono oggi gli Stati Uniti d'America. Sono gli anni della prosperità nazionale, ma anche quelli in cui si comincia a discutere di povertà, grandi corporazioni, razzismo, solitudine e alienazione, temi che preparano il grande conflitto culturale tra conservatori e liberali"".
Partiamo dal 1962, ci s'inizia ad interrogare sull'ambiente, sull'etica del business, sul femminismo. E il sesso diventa ancora più complicato: la tensione marca ogni rapporto, basato sull'apparenza.  
Nella serie, la cosa interessante è seguire l'impatto che la storia impone sulle vite di questi personaggi...""

The best of MAD MEN 📺 Don Draper & Rachel Menken - Kiss on the rooftop | HD with subtitles,kt6WXjaXDag,Beauty will save the world,UCand3PShD3xtASl_Mxla4YQ,2022-02-28T21:15:01Z,"New York City, 1960s. In the Golden Age of advertising, everyone is selling something and nothing is what it seems.
Don meets again with Rachel Menken. While there she gives him a pair of medieval knight cuff links and tells him stories about when she was a young girl and her father ran the store. She takes him to her favorite place in the store, the roof - where the store keeps its patrol dogs. Rachel explains that she was always close to the dogs as a young girl because her father liked to work a lot. Other than her sister, the dogs were her only companions, as her mother died while giving birth to her. After her revelation, Don kisses her,  impulsively and passionately, then admits to her that he is married, which stuns her. She feels foolish and asks that he put someone else in charge of her account at Sterling Cooper.
She completely charms Don Draper through her witty banter and brilliance, leading the two of them to engage in a heated affair. This affair eventually, along with a series of other plot-related details, drives Don to ask Rachel to run away with him.

- Mr. Kurland was mitigating a skirmish in our housewares section. Why do I hire young girls?
- Because they cost practically nothing. Costume change.
- This is my closet. 
...
- Well, it is crowded. But that might have something to do with the sale, which means that, if we're successful, you're gonna lose the customers you have in order to get the customers you want.
- I was gonna start with raising prices. Can you imagine what my father said?
- Well, you do have to give them something for their higher dollar count. It's just awfully hard to define what that is.
- How may I help you?
- I make them say that. Carol, can we see this tray right here? Sea horses, crowns, lucky dice. Medieval knights. That's better.
- Thank you.
- Let's take a look at the second floor. We're known for our service.
- That's gotta be a tough job.
- I know. I've always liked how quiet it is up here.
- Well, that might explain the lack of customers. I can see the charm, but... the room is too dark, too old-fashioned. The products look old.
- But the people look wonderful.
- It's a shame we're gonna have to lop their heads off. It'll ruin your favorite part of the store.
- It's not my favorite part, actually.
- Hell. Manhattan at your feet. I can see the appeal.
- The view's okay. Now, this is my favorite part of the store. Hey there, Missy. Hey. I haven't seen you in a while.
- Hey.
- How did they get the penthouse?
- They patrol. It's the only way to make sure there isn't anyone hiding in the store at night.
- Well, they know I'm with you, right?
- These two are Carla and Leona. Not the originals, but third generation, and what every generation of Menken dog shall be named until the end of time. I made my father's legal counsel add that to the store's by-laws when I was 9.
- So even then you enjoyed telling men what to do.
- To be fair, the store was practically home. My father liked to work. I used to come out here and talk to them... well, the originals... every night. For a little girl, a dog can be all you need. They protect you. They listen. I had my sister, but there weren't other kids. And, of course, my mother wasn't around.
- Well, that's not always a bad thing.
- Who knows? She died when she was having me. Anyway, my sister became my only company. And frankly, these bitches were easier to handle.
- What is this? Don't try to convince me that you were ever unloved.
- I don't know what to say.
- Listen... I'm married.
- I guess I didn't ask 'cause I didn't want to know.
- That shouldn't have happened.
- Well, you couldn't help yourself.
- I knew what I wanted... from the first time you stormed out of our office.
- You stormed out of your office. I took you up here. That was stupid. I just so looked forward to seeing you again. Now I guess that's over. I know you understand I'd rather not have to explain this to anyone. The account stays. I just want someone else on it. Don't look at me like that. What do you do, just kiss women all the time? Women you aren't married to?
- Of course not.
- Well, then, am I supposed to live some life running alongside yours? I have some checks to sign.

One season earlier, Pete had tried to blackmail Don into giving him a promotion. Pete’s plan backfired and Don could have had him fired. He did not and Bert Cooper gave him the wisdom that “one never knows how loyalty is born”.

00:00 Mad Men Style Review Introduction

Mad Men is among the most stylish TV shows aired, and as it’s set in the 1960s, we thought it would be great to pay a visit to Madison Avenue to see what the television hit series Mad Men got right and what they got wrong in terms of the men’s fashion during the time.

-- The Men of Mad Men and Their Style --
→ Don Draper: The Protagonist - played by Jon Hamm 
02:15 Business Suits: Typical, Not Spectacular
07:17 Casualwear: Period-Appropriate
08:30 Sport Coat: Typical in The 1960s
08:52 White Dinner Jacket & Tuxedo: Accurate For The Time
10:49 Hats: Rarely Worn
→ Roger Sterling: Best with Bold Details - played by John Slattery
11:56 Three-Piece Suits: Age- and Period-Appropriate
13:56 Accessories: Most Bold In The Series
→ Pete Campbell: Classic with Ivy/Prep Silhouettes - played by Vincent Kartheiser
15:16 Business Suit: Modern in Silhouette
16:53 Madras Jacket: A Hint of Prep Style
→ 17:48 Lane Pryce: Comfort with a British Touch
→ 19:52 Bert Cooper: Underlining Power by Breaking Rules - personified by Robert Morse
→ 20:52 Ken Cosgrove: Youthful and Dynamic Style - played by Aaron Staton -  played by Michael Gladis
→ 21:34 Paul Kinsey: An Unconventional, Artistic Type - played by Brian Batt
→ 23:25 Harry Crane: Still Learning the Style Ropes

Ultimately, Mad Men does a great job of superficially portraying 1960s men’s fashions, but maybe, just like with its main character, don’t look too closely at the details; you may not like what you find.

The best of MAD MEN 📺 Roger Don & Betty: Dinner pt. 2: What was that? | HD with subtitles,4QU-XbT93W0,Beauty will save the world,UCand3PShD3xtASl_Mxla4YQ,2023-07-18T16:30:01Z,"Roger Sterling spends the night reminiscing about his youth with Betty and Don Draper. When Don leaves, he drunkenly makes a move on Betty in the kitchen. 
This move is motivated by Joan not taking him up on his offer and the young girls at the bar who were more taken with Don. This is an attempt to assert his superiority over Don. His insecurity about aging, about losing his once infallible charm pushes him to compete with Draper, the guy who’s value to the agency is may soon surpass his. Roger, who believes he is in competition with Don, is not willing to lose and wants someone to react to him, to be charmed by him. To make him feel still viable, still virile. 
But Betty does not react the way he hoped. Standing very close to her, he slides his hands around her waist. She pushes his hand away, but he nuzzles her. “You’ve been making eyes at me all night,” he says, as drunk, horny, insecure men generally say when women laugh at their jokes and pretend to be interested in their blather. The sense of entitlement is overwhelming, and there are also aspects of jealousy and vindictiveness. 
While Betty deflects this unwanted attention, neither she nor Roger are able to quickly cover the awkwardness upon Don's return and the whole scene is so terribly uncomfortable. Don notices something wrong, but Roger quickly takes a drink for the road and says his goodbyes. 
Don returns to the kitchen and demands an explanation for what just happened. Don reveals that he’s as blind to Betty’s true intentions as Roger was and accuses Betty of throwing herself at Roger. She gets blamed for a drunk older man molesting her. Don gets angry and physical as he rages about being ""treated like that"" in his own house. Betty calls his brutish bluff, asking if he wants to bounce her off the walls, and Don instead echoes what Betty's therapist said about her, ""sometimes I feel like I'm living with a little girl."" He sort of is.

""Roger, like Don, would pretty much fuck anything that moves. He was drunk and Betty is beautiful. Sometimes for men like this, that’s all that matters."" 

Misogyny at its finest. Don was always a hypocrite. One rule for him, another for Betty.  He can do whatever he wants, but Betty can never once step out of line or even wear a bikini. He wants to maintain control over all his conquests. 

- Sally will be happy her cake was such a hit.
- Make sure you tell her I ate the ""M"" in ""Mom.""  Roger...
- I can't believe you've had two babies.
- Don't do that.
- You've been making eyes at me all night. You can't tell me that I'm not giving you hot pants. You smell so good.
- I can make more coffee.
- I just want you to know that when I go to sleep tonight, I will be thinking all about you. Where'd you go, to Russia to get that?
- No, I ran down the street knocking on doors.
- Come on, you two. Come on out here and wish me a bon voyage. I was just saying what a lucky man you are. Beautiful children. Enjoy it. One minute you're drinking at a bar, and they come and tell you your kid's been born, next thing you know, they're heading off to college. Well, I should be on my way. I'll take this for the road.
- I'll walk you out.
- Magical night.
- That's my car. There you go. Lights!
- What was that?
- What?
- That. Him. Felt like someone turned the oven on when I came back in here with that bottle.
- That's ridiculous.
- Bullshit.
- Nothing happened, Don. Other than your drunk boss ruining our evening. Can we leave it at that?
- You seemed to be having a grand time.
- I liked the wine.
- You made a fool of yourself.
- Why would you say that?
- You were throwing yourself at him. Giggling at his stories.
- I was being friendly. He's your boss.
- I don't like to be treated that way in my own home. I know what I saw.
- You want to bounce me off the walls? Would that make you feel better?
- Sometimes I feel like I'm living with a little girl.

The best of MAD MEN 📺 What you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons | HD,HqM0QvbMYeg,Beauty will save the world,UCand3PShD3xtASl_Mxla4YQ,2022-02-21T23:00:05Z,"New York City, 1960s. In the Golden Age of advertising, everyone is selling something and nothing is what it seems.
Rachel Menken enters the first season of Mad Men as an ambitious and modern Jewish American businesswoman, looking to transform Menken’s department store into something contemporary, stylish, and innovative. She employs Sterling Cooper, an esteemed ad agency dominated by white men in designer suits, to bring her vision for Menken’s department store into fruition. 
Don tries to talk to Rachel a second time after their disappointing meeting. He admits he acted unprofessionally and Rachel immediately accepts his apology. Don changes the subject by grilling Rachel on why she isn't married, and Rachel explains that she finds business to be a thrill, and she doesn't ""wear an apron"" because she has never been in love. Don explains his philosophy on love and life.
She completely charms Don Draper through her witty banter and brilliance, leading the two of them to engage in a heated affair. This affair eventually, along with a series of other plot-related details, drives Don to ask Rachel to run away with him.

Don in many ways exhibits the thinking of an existentialist — the lack of innate meaning in life is what gives you the freedom to choose. But he also, at times, lets that facade crack, and his view turns nihilistic, as it does in his nylons monologue. 
Don is great at constructing meaning, even when — especially when — there isn’t anything there. He invents a story, convinces others it’s the case, then comes to believe it himself. He tells people that something is what they’ve always wanted, even if it never really was. 

- You got in trouble, didn't you?
- I shouldn't have lost my temper, and I certainly shouldn't have treated you like anything less than a client.
- Apology accepted.
- So you understand.
- Now I do. It was, uh, refreshing, really. I mean, actually hearing all the things I always assumed people were thinking.
- Well, I'm not really as bad as all that. I was under a lot of pressure. Another account.
- Doesn't really matter.
- No, it doesn't.
- So, without making things worse, can I ask you a personal question?
- Don't you want to get a second drink in me first?
- Why aren't you married?
- Are you asking what's wrong with me?
- It's just that you're a beautiful, educated woman. Don't you think that getting married
and having a family would make you happier than all the headaches that go along with... fighting people like me?
- If I weren't a woman, I would be allowed to ask you the same question. And if I weren't a woman, I wouldn't have to choose between putting on an apron and the thrill of making my father's store what I always thought it should be.
- So that's it. You won't get married because you find business to be a thrill.
- That and... I've never been in love.
- She won't get married because she's never been in love. I think I wrote that once to sell nylons.
- For a lot of people, love isn't just a slogan.
- Oh, you mean love. You mean the big lightning bolt to the heart where you can't eat and you can't work and you just run off and get married and make babies. The reason you haven't felt it is because it doesn't exist. What you call lovewas invented by guys like me to sell nylons.
- Is that right?
- I'm pretty sure about it. You're born alone, and you die alone, and this world just drops a bunch of rules on the top of you to make you forget those facts, but I never forget. I'm living like there's no tomorrow... because there isn't one.
- I don't think I realized it until this moment, but it must be hard being a man, too.
- Excuse me?
- Mr. Draper...
- Don.
- Mr. Draper, I don't know what it is you really believe in, but I do know what it feels like to be out of place, to be disconnected, to see the whole world laid out in front of you the way other people live it. There is something about you that tells me you know it, too.
- I don't know if that's true. You want another drink?
- No. But you can tell your boss that you charmed me.
- So I guess we'll be seeing each other again.
- I'll be back in the office Monday morning, for a real meeting.
- I'd like that.

It's the last episode EVER, but did Mad Men's final episode satisfy? The episode gives the air that the characters continue to live their lives in a way that doesn't shock or take a twist, but would it have been better if the episode shot off in a different direction altogether? Many have speculated about Don Draper and where the end of Mad Men would take him, and his ending shows that his arch wasn't toward irrelevance, but actually the opposite. How did the ending play out vs. Don and Betty's final conversation? Did Don grown, or is he the same man from the pilot?
