The Ending Of Lost Finally Explained,lqPeBdIHyGM,Looper,UCP1iRaFlS5EYjJBryFV9JPw,2019-10-06T22:00:09Z,"Lost was a show that introduced so many mysteries over the course of six seasons that fans were nervous about how it would all wrap up in the finale. Ultimately, the ABC drama disappointed a lot of viewers with “The End,” as it seemed to go in a predictable and unsatisfying direction, but there might be more to the show’s final episode than you realized the first time. From the truth about whether the characters actually died in a plane wreck to the meaning of all those scenes set in an alternate reality, let’s take a look at the explanation of the ending of Lost.

Doctor Reacts To LOST TV Show Medical Scenes,JAvPDe50zKg,Doctor Mike,UC0QHWhjbe5fGJEPz3sVb6nw,2021-05-12T18:22:52Z,"I’ve never seen Lost, but I’ve been getting all sorts of comments lately asking me to react to the medical scenes. Turns out there were a ton of medical moments throughout the series, anchored by Matthew Fox as Dr. Jack Shephard. I reacted to the opening pilot sequence on the beach, Evangeline Lilly as Kate stitching Jack’s wound, Jack saving Charlie with some chest compressions/chest thumps, Sayid sealing Charlie’s head wound with fire, Jack performing spinal surgery on Ben’s tumor, Juliet giving Jack an appendectomy, and the wild “Do Not Harm” episode where John Locke brings Boone in with a broken leg while Claire is giving birth. So much drama. Any scenes I missed that you want me to react to in a future video? Drop them down below!

Special thanks for helping source these scenes to Brian Tochterman Jr. Erin O’Conner, Tara Bennett, and the LOST SUPPORT GROUP on Facebook!

I tried finding the best quality (HD) and most recent pictures from all of the actors and actresses in the video. Hopefully you can appreciate the effort.

Lost is an American science fiction drama television series created by Jeffrey Lieber, J.J. Abrams, and Damon Lindelof that aired on ABC from September 22, 2004, to May 23, 2010, over six seasons, comprising a total of 121 episodes. The show contains elements of supernatural fiction, and follows the survivors of a commercial jet airliner flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, after the plane crashes on a mysterious island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean. Episodes typically feature a primary storyline set on the island, augmented by flashback or flashforward sequences which provide additional insight into the involved characters.

Lindelof and Carlton Cuse serve as showrunners and are executive producers along with Abrams and Bryan Burk. Inspired by the 2000 Tom Hanks film Cast Away, the show is told in a heavily serialized manner. Due to its large ensemble cast and the cost of filming primarily on location in Oahu, Hawaii, the series was one of the most expensive on television, with the pilot alone costing over $14 million. The fictional universe and mythology of Lost were expanded upon by a number of related media, most importantly, a series of short mini-episodes called Missing Pieces, and a 12-minute epilogue titled ""The New Man in Charge"".

Lost has regularly been ranked by critics as one of the greatest television series of all time. The first season had an estimated average of 16 million viewers per episode on ABC. During its sixth and final season, the show averaged over 11 million U.S. viewers per episode. Lost was the recipient of hundreds of industry award nominations throughout its run and won numerous of these awards, including the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 2005, Best American Import at the British Academy Television Awards in 2005, the Golden Globe Award for Best Drama in 2006, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Drama Series.
