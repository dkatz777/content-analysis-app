In the thrilling new event series PRISON BREAK, original series stars Wentworth Miller, Dominic Purcell, Sarah Wayne Callies, Amaury Nolasco, Robert Knepper, Rockmond Dunbar and Paul Adelstein are reunited for an all-new adventure spanning the globe and featuring the signature thrills and cliffhangers that were hallmarks of the original series when it aired on FOX from 2005-2009.

The original action drama centered on MICHAEL SCOFIELD (Miller, “The Loft”), a young man determined to save his convicted brother, LINCOLN BURROWS (Purcell, “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow”), from death row by hatching an elaborate plan to escape from prison.

In the all-new event series, filmed on location in Morocco, clues surface that suggest a previously thought-to-be-dead Michael may be alive. Lincoln and SARA (Sarah Wayne Callies, “Colony,” “The Walking Dead”), Michael’s wife until he was presumed dead, reunite to engineer the series’ biggest escape ever, as three of Fox River State Penitentiary’s most notorious escapees, SUCRE (Nolasco, “Telenovela”), T-BAG (Knepper, “Heroes”) and C-NOTE (Dunbar, “The Mentalist”), are pulled back into the action.

“Prison Break” was an immediate critical and ratings hit when it premiered on FOX in the fall of 2005, garnering Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Television Series – Drama and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Drama (Miller). The original producing team, including series creator Paul T. Scheuring, Neal Moritz, Marty Adelstein and Dawn Olmstead, return to executive-produce the new series, with Scheuring serving as showrunner/writer.

PRISON BREAK is produced by 20th Century Fox Television. Paul T. Scheuring, Vaun Wilmott, Michael Horowitz, Dawn Olmstead, Nelson McCormick, Marty Adelstein and Neal Moritz serve as executive producers. McCormick also serves as a director on the series. “Like” PRISON BREAK on Facebook at facebook.com/prisonbreak. Follow the series on Twitter @PrisonBreak and join the discussion using #PrisonBreak.

The Inevitable Downfall Of Prison Break,I31QIx3EM1M,Nerdstalgic,UCXjmz8dFzRJZrZY8eFiXNUQ,2025-04-28T17:00:31Z,"When Prison Break first premiered on FOX, it became an instant hit. With a high-stakes story, intense drama, and a unique premise, Season 1 felt like must-watch television. Competing with powerhouse shows like Lost and 24, Prison Break needed to come out swinging — and it did.  But after the actual prison break, fans started to wonder: Where does the story go from here? As the series progressed, Prison Break pushed the limits of plausibility and began stretching its core concept in unexpected ways.  Leading to a dramatic downfall, most fans could see coming from a mile away. 

Did Prison Break go too far? Or was it a bold evolution of a high-concept series?

prison break remix Akon soundtrack,quEIyVASZWc,alen,UCb2OHB0aGjmFiNRo5PVjD_Q,2007-10-01T01:25:28Z,"Prison Break is an American television series that premiered on the Fox Network on August 29 2005. The story revolves around a man who was sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit and his brother's elaborate plan to help him escape his death sentence. Created by Paul Scheuring, the show is produced by Adelstein-Parouse Productions in association with Original Television and 20th Century Fox Television. The current executive producers are Paul Scheuring, Matt Olmstead, Dawn Parouse, Marty Adelstein, Neal Moritz, and Brett Ratner.[1] Its theme music is composed by Ramin Djawadi, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2006.[2]

Currently, two seasons of the show have been aired. Due to its immense popularity in its key demographics, the show was renewed by Fox for a third season,[3] even though it was originally conceived to have only two seasons. The uniqueness of Prison Break is attributed to its serialized story structure, a similar format used by Lost and 24, and its setting as very few television series were primarily set and filmed in a prison.[4] Its success and recognition as a prison drama revived interest in the genre.[5]

William Fichtner (Prison Break, Black Hawk Down) joins us this week to share his multi decade journey through Hollywood working alongside legends on the screen and how it all started with a random referral while in college. Ficthner gives insight into his process and how, without fail, he always puts in the work before playing any role; expanding on this with a story of his blind character in Robert Zemeckis’ Contact. We also talk about favoring performance over appearance, entering an industry as an outsider, and not chasing people’s approval.
