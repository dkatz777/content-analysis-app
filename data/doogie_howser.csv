Doogie Howser, M.D. is an American medical drama that ran for four seasons on ABC from September 19, 1989, to March 24, 1993, totaling 97 episodes. Created by Steven Bochco and David E. Kelley, the show stars Neil Patrick Harris in the title role as a teenage physician who balances the challenge of practicing medicine with the everyday problems of teenage life.
Dr. Douglas ""Doogie"" Howser (Harris) is the son of David (James B. Sikking) and Katherine Howser (Belinda Montgomery). As a child, he twice survived early-stage pediatric leukemia after his fatherâ€”a family physicianâ€”discovered suspicious bruising. The experience contributed to the younger Howser's desire to enter medicine.
Possessing a genius intellect and an eidetic memory, Howser participates in a longitudinal study of child prodigies until his 18th birthday. He earned a perfect score on the SAT at the age of six, completed high school in nine weeks, graduated from Princeton University in 1983[6] at age 10, and finished medical school four years later. At age 14, Howser was the youngest licensed doctor in the country. As a newspaper article (one of several noting some of Doogie's aforementioned accomplishments that are shown in the series' opening title sequence) stated, he ""can't buy beer... [but] can prescribe drugs"".

Ryan Reynolds Mocks Neil Patrick Harris in Doogie Howser Spoof | Deadpool VR Drama ðŸ¤¯ðŸŽ®,PPZOPP1pUU8,HipPopHumor,2025-06-09T22:01:22Z,"Ryan Reynolds just dropped a comedy bomb after losing the Deadpool VR voice role to Neil Patrick Harris â€” and itâ€™s a Doogie Howser M.D. parody for the ages. ðŸ’»ðŸ‘¨â€âš•ï¸
In this hilarious skit, Reynolds journals about â€œbuttholesâ€ who steal iconic roles, stays (kind of) in character as a 14-year-old prodigy, and even gets called out by his real-life sister-in-law Robyn Lively.
Watch the full spoof and decide: should Meta have picked Ryan or is NPH the new Merc with a Mouth?

Dressed in a lab coat and glasses, Reynolds hilariously pokes fun at the recasting by typing exaggeratedly on a keyboard, throwing shade, and channeling the young prodigy vibes of Harrisâ€™s Doogie Howser, M.D. This perfectly executed parody is not just a marketing win but a masterclass in self-aware humor thatâ€™s pure Deadpool energy. Whether you're a Marvel fan, a gamer, or just love Reynolds' signature sass, this reaction is a must-watch. The video offers laughs, clever nods to pop culture, and a playful jab at being replaced.

"Theme from Doogie Howser, M.D. (3-month piano progress video)",cF3qjuGkFVE,Nicholas Dunham,2018-11-18T10:40:13Z,"Three months of piano learning progressâ€”I started playing piano on August 18, 2018, and recorded this video on November 17, 2018.

The Doogie Howser, M.D. theme song was written by the great Mike Post, who also wrote themes for The A-Team, The Greatest American Hero, Magnum PI, and about half of the soundtrack of my childhood. Like a lot of his 80s themes, the Doogie Howser theme makes prominent use of the Yamaha DX-7's ""E PIANO 1"" preset. I'm using Dexed, a free FM software synthesizer that can load DX-7 patches.

I know my rhythm isn't perfect, and there's a moment toward the end where for a second I couldn't remember what chords came nextâ€”but hey, I've only been playing piano for three months. I'll do better next time.","piano,doogie howser md",10,1211,27,4,PT1M13S,hd,public

Doogie Howser, M.D. is an American television comedy-drama starring Neil Patrick Harris as a 16-year-old doctor who,
also faces the problems of being a normal teenager. Created by Steven Bochco and David E. Kelley, 
ABC aired the show from 1989 to 1993 for four seasons totaling 97 episodes.


Series Info --:

Long before Neil Patrick Harris portrayed the skirt-chasing Barney Stinson in ""How I Met Your Mother,"" he
was a favorite of TV audiences as medical prodigy Dr. Douglas ""Doogie"" Howser in this 1989-'93 comedy-
drama. Created by Steven Bochco and David E. Kelley, the series follows Doogie's daily trials and travails at 
work, the problems that come along with the notoriety as the country's youngest surgeon, and his personal 
life as a regular teenager who just wants to borrow his dad's car to take his girlfriend out on a date. When 
he's not tackling social issues of the day or butting heads with his stern but wise father, Dr. David Howser 
(James B. Sikking), Doogie pals around with window-entering best bud Vinnie Delpino (Max Casella) and 
always finds time to post select tidbits of wisdom into his computer journal.

Doogie Howser, M.D. is an American medical comedy-drama television series that ran for four seasons on ABC from September 19, 1989, to March 24, 1993, totaling 97 episodes. Created by Steven Bochco and David E. Kelley, the show stars Neil Patrick Harris in the title role as a teenage physician who balances the challenge of practicing medicine with the everyday problems of teenage life. 
The Wonder Years is an American coming-of-age comedy-drama television series created by Neal Marlens and Carol Black.[2] It ran on ABC from 1988 until May 12, 1993. The pilot aired on January 31, 1988, following ABC's coverage of Super Bowl XXII.[3][4][4][5] It stars Fred Savage as Kevin Arnold, an adolescent boy growing up in a suburban middle-class family, and takes place from 1968 to 1973.

The show earned a spot in the Nielsen Top 30 during its first four seasons.[6] TV Guide named it one of the 20 best shows of the 1980s.[6] After six episodes, The Wonder Years won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1988.[6] In addition, at age 13, Fred Savage became the youngest actor ever nominated as Outstanding Lead Actor for a Comedy Series. The show was also awarded a Peabody Award in 1989 for ""pushing the boundaries of the sitcom format and using new modes of storytelling"".[7] In total, the series won 22 awards and was nominated for 54 more.[8] In 1997, ""My Father's Office"" was ranked #29 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time,[9] and in the 2009 revised list the pilot episode was ranked #43.[10] In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked The Wonder Years #63 on its list of 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[11] In 2017, James Charisma of Paste ranked the show's opening sequence #14 on a list of The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time.[12] As of recent years many critics and fans consider The Wonder Years to be a classic[13] with tremendous impact on the industry over the years, inspiring many other shows and how they are structured.[14]

Doogie Howser was a bad person?,mmOBpZVZH8k,HeckleTV,2020-10-21T23:58:09Z,"I loved the show Doogie Howser when I was growing up. I recently started watching the series again on Hulu, because I thought it might be fun to see it again as an adult. The show is dated, of course, but for the most part holds up okay when it comes to the moral lessons that Dr. Howser learns each episode. Except for one episode that really stood out to me. Season 1, episode 9 titled, ""She ain't heavy, she's my cousin."" Doogie sets up Vinnie with Wanda's cousin from Miami. Vinnie thinks he's getting a ""tropical beauty"" but she turns out to be more than what he expected. 

The episode fumbles around the topic of obesity and clumsily falls flat on its face. Doogie and Vinnie show that they are not all that nice when it comes to people who struggle with their weight, and are extremely judgmental without taking the time to truly understand the situation. Doogie is supposed to be a genius doctor, yet he can't figure out when someone needs help from a mental health professional instead of ridicule and shame.

This episode did not age well and sends a misguided message to its viewers. Then again, what do I know? I'm not a genius or a doctor.","Doogie Howser,Doogie Howser MD,Neil Patrick Harris,Max Casella,Lisa Dean Ryan,Vinnie Depino,Wanda Plenn,Season 1,Episode 9,Doogie Howser Season 1,Fat Shaming,Obesity,Obesity Epidemic,Mental Health,Eating Disorder,Binge Eating,Body Dysmorphia,1989,Lesley Boone,Yvette,Kid Doctor,Dr. Mike,Dr Mike and Doogie Howser,Fat Shaming Doesn't Help Obesity,Keep Weight Off,Healthy Diet,Unhealthy Diet,Kid Genius,Genius Doctor,Doctor Doogie,Dear Fat People",24,824,22,16,PT23M29S,hd,public
