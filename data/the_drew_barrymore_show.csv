Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Aniston on Adam Sandler | Mark Twain Prize,v9cCvDwRnvU,The Kennedy Center,2023-03-27T03:54:34Z,"Watch the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor celebrating Adam Sandler on CNN.com or CNNgo.

https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/

The Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize, which is named to honor one of the worldâ€™s greatest humorists, was awarded to Adam Sandler at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy -- including Chris Rock, Conan O'Brien, Ben Stiller, Dana Carvey, Pete Davidson, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Anniston, Idina Menzel, David Spade, and more -- on March 19, 2023, and aired nationally on CNN on March 26, 2023.

The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.

â€œAdam Sandler has entertained audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,â€ said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this yearâ€™s recipient. â€œAdam has created characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to bring together the best in comedy.â€

In an episode of â€œThe Drew Barrymore Show,â€ which aired Tuesday, Oct. 22, Pamela, Drew, and Valerie all showed off their bare faces, with the actress sharing why she ditched makeup for good. â€œIsn't it freeing? Doesn't it feel free? I feel free. I mean, it's taken a while too; I've had my little, you know, journey with it, but we all are our own worst critics,â€ she said in part, before explaining that she began attending events makeup-free in September 2023 when she stepped out for Fashion Week. â€œI was at Paris Fashion Week and decided [if] I was just going to a fashion show, I didn't need to compete with anybody. Like, why am I wasting three hours in a makeup chair when I have these beautiful Vivienne Westwood clothes on,â€ she said, adding, â€œAnd I didn't realize anyone would even notice. So then, when people started coming up to me and talking about it, I thought, 'Well, this is a great message.'â€

Drew Barrymore Playfully PUSHED AWAY By Martha Stewart In TV Interview,lfzv6cNdxGY,Access Hollywood,2024-11-12T23:00:36Z,"In a touchy interview moment, Martha Stewart pushed Drew Barrymore away during a recent appearance on her talk show. While the women spoke, Barrymore asked Stewart what makes her â€œsoft and gooeyâ€ and briefly rubbed her arm. Stewart came up with a witty response, telling Barrymore, â€œyouâ€™re the wrong gender,â€ before playfully pushing the talk show host away from her. The moment is drawing renewed attention to  Barrymoreâ€™s interview style. The 49-year-old has been called out by viewers for getting physically close with her guests.

Bring out the original Glinda wand, please,â€ the 49-year-old announced as the singer covered her mouth in shock. â€œAre you serious right now?"" Ariana said after she received the wand to hold. The â€œWe Canâ€™t Be Friendsâ€ singer then jokingly walked away with the memorabilia before turning around and returning to the couch. â€œThank you guys, it's been fun. Bye - I'm kidding.

In a world where reality TV often pushes boundaries and tests public limits, Meghan Markle's newest foray into the culinary world has raised more than just eyebrows. Her Netflix cooking show, touted as a groundbreaking series aimed at showcasing her talents beyond the royal spotlight, has quickly become the center of intense scrutinyâ€”and itâ€™s not just from the usual critics. This time, the voice that has stirred the most controversy is none other than Martha Stewart, a woman who knows the kitchen better than most. Stewart, known for her poised, yet sharp observations, did not mince words when it came to the Duchess of Sussexâ€™s cooking debut.

Drew Barrymore Reveals the Surprising Sleeping Position She Discovered During Pregnancy & Still Uses,I_sva5MOnA8,Indian Guru ,2025-01-01T10:13:55Z,"Drew Barrymore, 49, has shared a surprising detail about her sleep routine that she discovered during pregnancy and still uses today. The actress and talk show host revealed that she sleeps with a body pillow, just as she did when she was expecting her two daughters. ""I sleep with a body pillow like Iâ€™m still pregnant!"" Barrymore toldÂ PEOPLE.

As a mom, businesswoman, and someone with a constantly busy mind, Barrymore found it difficult to get quality rest, often tossing and turning or staying up late. However, she has recently found that creating a cooler sleep environment has been a ""game-changer"" for her. She partnered with Rest in November as the bedding brandâ€™s official â€œSleep Wellness Advocateâ€ and credits their Evercool Cooling Comforter for improving her sleep. Barrymore noted that she has never slept better and even had to get separate comforters for her daughters, Olive and Frankie, as they started stealing hers.

TheÂ Drew Barrymore ShowÂ host also emphasized the importance of prioritizing sleep, likening it to nutrition and exercise in terms of necessity. ""We canâ€™t be our best selves without a good nightâ€™s rest,"" she said, explaining that quality sleep is crucial for mental and physical well-being. Barrymoreâ€™s bedtime routine includes reading or saying goodnight to her cats and dog before falling asleep quickly.

For Drew, quality sleep is essential to her health and how she shows up in the world.
