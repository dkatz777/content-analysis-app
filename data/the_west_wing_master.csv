John Amos Americas TV Dad has gone on to be with the Lord at 84 years young #johnamos,5JdhY5CxPqA,Indignant Desert Birds,2024-10-01T20:59:59Z,"America dad John Amos has gone on to be with the Lord at 84 years young 

Actor John Amos, whose long career included a range of iconic roles in such works as ""Roots,"" ""Good Times"" and ""The West Wing,"" died in August, his family said Tuesday.
He was 84 when he died from natural causes in Los Angeles on Aug. 21, according to a statement from the actor's publicist.

""With a career spanning over five decades, Amos leaves behind a legacy of groundbreaking work on both television and film, and a dedication to positive African American representation in media,"" the statement read.
Kelly Christopher Amos called his father ""my dad, my best friend, and my hero.""
â€œIt is with heartfelt sadness that I share with you that my father has transitioned,â€ the younger Amos said.
â€œHe was a man with the kindest heart and a heart of gold â€¦ and he was loved the world over. Many fans consider him their TV father. He lived a good life. His legacy will live on in his outstanding works in television and film as an actor.â€Â

We did not seek nor did we provoke an assault on our freedom and our way of life. We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation with evil. Yet the true measure of a people's strength is how they rise to master that moment when it does arrive. 44 people were killed a couple of hours ago at Kennison State University. Three swimmers from the men's team were killed and two others are in critical condition. When, after having heard the explosion from their practice facility, they ran into the fire to help get people out. Ran *in* to the fire. The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels tonight. They're our students and our teachers and our parents and our friends. The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels, but every time we think we have measured our capacity to meet a challenge, we look up and we're reminded that that capacity may well be limitless. This is a time for American heroes. We will do what is hard. We will achieve what is great. This is a time for American heroes and we reach for the stars. God bless their memory, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.

While answering questions about marijuana, Dr. Griffith pointed out the effects of the drug in comparison to alcohol and cigarettes and its illegal status. The press took this as her supporting the decriminalization of marijuana and the President asked for her letter of resignation, which she refused to give. Before she could be fired her goddaughter, Ellie Bartlet, told a reporter that her father would never fire the Surgeon General. This further complicated matters and brought up certain issues that had plagued Ellie's and the President's relationship.

This video is everything to me and while I don't think it made the show justice at all, I did put my heart into it and I do think that I showed what I love about this show. Unfortunately there are so many characters that I love that I barely (or not at all) showed in this one, but the song was just too short for it. But in my next TWW videos I will definitely have time for it!

Dedicated to my parents who got me into watching this show. They have been begging me for years to do it and I'm so happy they did! This is truly our show.

Come they told me

A new born King to see,
Pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
So to honor Him
Pa rum pum pum pum,
When we come.

Little Baby
Pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too,
Pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give our King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Shall I play for you!
Pa rum pum pum
On my drum.

Mary nodded
Pa rum pum pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time
Pa rum pum pum pum
I played my drum for Him
Pa rum pum pum
I played my best for Him
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Then He smiled at me
Pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum.


""The Little Drummer Boy"" is a Christmas song from 1958 - words and music by Katherine K. Davis, Henry Onorati, and Harry Simeone. The best-known and most standard version is by the Harry Simeone Chorale. It is also known as the ""Carol of the Drum"".

The words and music to the Christmas song Little Drummer Boy was composed by Katherine K. Davis, Henry Onorati and Harry Simeone in 1958. The lyrics of Little Drummer Boy consist of no less than 21 rum pum pum pum' - a major part of the song and therefore presenting an apparently easy task for the lyricist! However, Little Drummer Boy has been a huge hit for several artists.

The lyrics tell the apocryphal story of a poor young boy who, unable to afford a gift for the infant Jesus, plays his drum for the newborn with the Virgin Mary's approval.","Little,Drummer,Boy",10,1663658,9940,1817,PT4M46S,sd,public

A smart guy said the Presidential elections are won and lost on one square
foot of real
estate. [points to his head] Up here.

TOBY
Well, that's great.

LEO
Yeah.

TOBY
All right, we still got a day and half before he debates. We'll go back
to school.

LEO
I think that's just going to pour gas on the problem.

TOBY
What do you want to do?

LEO
We've got a two-minute drill right now. I think whatever answers he gives
we should
just say ""That's terrific, Mr. President.""

TOBY
Then what's the point of the two-minute drill?

LEO
We got five of them scheduled before tomorrow night. We're using one of them
for this.

TOBY
This is crazy. I don't believe this.

LEO
That's terrific, Mr. President.

TOBY
All right.

Toby and Leo enter the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.

SAM
Leo...

TOBY
Listen, we're going to do something in the... in the drill right now.

SAM
What?

TOBY
No notes, just positive reinforcement.

SAM
Why?

TOBY
He has a problem this morning.

SAM
All right. Leo, I've got a 9:30 flight. I'll be there sometime after lunch.

LEO
You really can't do this with a phone call?

SAM
Oh, God, I don't know. The man died. There's a widow. We're asking them
to pack.
I'm an hour and 15 minutes away in a rental car, and we didn't make it
personal.

LEO
All right, I just need you in San Diego.

They see Josh in the HALLWAY.

TOBY
Josh!

LEO
We're still looking for ten words.

JOSH
I'm still looking for them, too.

LEO
Ten words, ten words-- let's go.

JOSH
We're going to expand the field.

They all enter the OUTER OVAL OFFICE. C.J.'s already there.

TOBY
No notes during this drill. [to C.J.] That's you, too.

C.J.
What's that?

TOBY
No notes during the drill.

JOSH
Why?

TOBY
He's in his head.

JOSH
There's pretty important feedback in the two-minute drills.

TOBY
We've got four more. We've got one on the plane.

C.J.
When is Debbie actually starting?

LEO
The President sent her to the Maxwell school for a three-day crash course
in everything.

TOBY
You know you've got a ten dollar bill in there on your clipboard.

C.J.
Yeah. I owe it to someone.

CHARLIE
You can all go on in.

JOSH
Thank you.

They all go inside THE OVAL OFFICE.

BARTLET
Ten words. Ten words.

JOSH
We don't have them yet, Mr. President.

BARTLET
All right, let's do a drill.

C.J.
Mr. President, despite a rise in tension around the globe, you've held up
funding for
a missile defense shield.

BARTLET
Too much money for too little protection.

ALL
Good.

BARTLET
Next.

JOSH
Sir, you oppose a voucher system that would offer children a choice of
better schools...

BARTLET
That would offer some children a choice of better schools, but I haven't
given up the
ghost on better schools for everybody, and vouchers drain money from that goal.

TOBY
Mr. President, this next question is on capital punishment, which you oppose:
If your
youngest daughter Zoey was raped and murdered, would you not want to see
the man
responsible put to death?

BARTLET
First of all, it's important to understand the President doesn't make that
decision,
though he appoints the Supreme Court Justices who do
so. What... any... um... All
right, I'm not going to say that. I'll just go right to... No, I don't. I
think you
know that I'm opposed.... [sighs] Let's not do that. I haven't seen any
evidence that
it's a deterrent, and there are more effective... In my state...

TOBY
Oh, my God.

BARTLET
What?

TOBY
[to Leo] You weren't kidding. [to Bartlet] What's the matter with you? When
I left
you... I just mentioned your daughter being murdered, and you're giving us
an answer
that's not only soporific, it's barely human! Yes, you'd want to see him
put to death.
You'd want it to be cruel and unusual, which is why it's probably a good
idea that
fathers of murder victims don't have legal rights in these situations. Now,
we're
going back to school.

There is a long pause of silence, then they all begin to laugh.

BARTLET
Let's go-- ten bucks. Crisis of confidence. [to Leo] You did one square foot
of real
estate.

LEO
Yes, I did.

BARTLET
Ten bucks for you. [to Toby] And you-- You big bear, come to me. I'm going
to kiss
you right on the mouth.

C.J.
Ten bucks.

LEO
Anything else, sir?

BARTLET
Work hard.

ALL
Thank you, sir.

They head back out to the OUTER OVAL OFFICE.

JOSH
[to Sam] Have a safe flight.

SAM
I'll see you in San Diego.

JOSH
[to Toby] Sorry about that. It was the President idea. He bet us you couldn't
stay quiet
if he gave a bad answer. What?

TOBY
He's ready.","The West Wing,Prank,Funny",1,1051888,3671,159,PT3M47S,sd,public

Copyright of course goes to Warner Bros. Television

Some very good acting from Martin Sheen as President Bartlet, where you can see he knows that Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff) was the leaker, with a bit of back and forth banter in between, but does not state it out loud and simply frames the problem for Toby trusting that Toby will do the right thing, despite how furious President Bartlet is with Toby. Not once in the scene does President Bartlet look Toby Ziegler in the eye.

Included is the follow up between CJ (Allison Janney) & Toby where he admits his guilt to her.

"Missing John Spencer, The West Wing Cast Found Comfort In Sterling K. Brown Who Took Up The Role",vTdCqIblKtk,The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,2020-10-10T07:35:00Z,"Part 2 - The ""Hartsfield Landing"" episode was a poignant choice given our current moment of voting-related crisis, and it was especially touching for the cast because of the heart wrenching absence of cast member John Spencer whose role was reverently played 18 years later by the incomparable Sterling K. Brown. ""A West Wing Special to Benefit When We All Vote"" premieres October 15th on HBO Max.

One of the more inspirational President Josiah Bartlet speeches from ""The West Wing""

I am only putting this up here as I cannot find this speech out of the thousands of The West Wing clips on YouTube and I think that is a travesty.

Copyright of course goes to Warner Bros. Television

I up-scaled the video to 1440p so YouTube doesn't degrade the quality more than it would normally, but it still looks ok.
--------------------------------------------------------
President Josiah ""Jed"" Bartlet: Thank You very much. Thank You.
""Joy cometh in the morning"", scripture tells us.
I hope so. I don't know if life would be worth living if it didn't.
And I don't yet know who set off the bomb at Kennison State. I don't know if it's one person or ten, and I don't know what they want.
All I know for sure, all I know for certain, is that they weren't born wanting to do this.
There's evil in the world, there'll always be, and we can't do anything about that.
But there's violence in our schools, too much mayhem in our culture, and we can do something about that.
There's not enough character, discipline, and depth in our classrooms; there aren't enough teachers in our classrooms.
There isn't nearly enough, not nearly enough, not nearly enough money in our classrooms, and we can do something about that.

Coloring adjusted from original coloring by Hermy483.
~~

As I say in my Josh/Donna video, this show completely changed my mind about what tv show should be like. I finished it a few weeks ago, and it became my all time favorite show. I just have no words to explain my love for it. 

Vidding it is so so soooo hard! There is so many great moments, and there is not a song that is long enough to make a great video to make it justice. I guess I tried to focus on the core characters as individuals, and also as little pieces of the puzzle. They are all extremely lonely people. Who keep making sacrifices for their mega important jobs. And I think that what's bringing them together, their love for their country and their devotion to their leader. There are all interesting and complicated characters who went through a long journey in the show. 

This is the only show I have ever watched that I can't select a favorite characters because I just love them all so much. I can't choose one. The video is mainly focused on seasons 1-4 which are the best ones in my opinion (which is probably the opinion of every west wing watcher), but don't get me wrong, unlike other shows I do like season 5-7. I just love them less. It wasn't the same, but it was still fantastic.   There are many more brilliant characters in this show that I haven't included in the video - will, santos, vinnick, denny, amy etc and I barely used any charlie. And there are many relationships that are barely or not at all in it (cj/danny, charlie/jed, jed/toby, toby/josh), and many important scenes that I didn't use. The song was just too short:-/  so I'm sorry for that. 

I don't think this video is my best work at all. I used many voiceovers and stuff and most of you know I'm not a fan of them at all! But it is impossible to vid this show without them, cause the amazing inspirational script is one of the things I love the most about the show. 

Anyway. This video is dedicated to the lovely emma (smumsi -- she is the most amazing vidder) who is the only person here that I talk about the show, and she always makes me so happy! With her personality and also with her art in her amazing video! (check her account, I mean it. best!) so I hope you like it hun xx

I don't know how many people will watch this video honestly. Some people don't have patience for long videos (and that's understandable), and it's also a fandom that almost no one in this community know/watch. So I'm not expecting too much feedback. But the ones who will take the time to watch it, thank you guys so so much! And also, if you're reading this and you haven't watched it, I strongly (understatement) recommend you to watch it. Trust me you won't regret it!

What if Obama's administration was put to the theme of The West Wing? Well, now you can find out!

100,000+ views, thanks for watching!!!

Original: Happy New Year to those of you waiting for this new intro - just in time for the inauguration on Janurary 20! 

I just thought this little mashup was a fun idea - I'm not trying to push a political agenda here! I just thought it'd be fun to imagine if we were to see the grandure of the idealistic ""West Wing"" in real life. 

This was shown on CNN's Showbiz Tonight!!
http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/showbiz/2009/01/17/sbt.seg.01.16.cnn
about 1:34 into the video.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What if Barack Obama's top advisors were part of the show The West Wing?  As promised, a new video introduction of senior White House advisors, in the style of the tv show, The West Wing.  This is a follow up to ""The Campaign Trail,"" which featured top advisors from the 2008 Presidential Election in a West Wing style opening credits, which you can watch here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUhCIYo_jXM

 Now, we have the ""Real West Wing.""  In this video, we have [with their TV counterparts]:

David Axelrod - Senior Advisor
Joe Biden - Vice President [Hoynes/Russell]
Rahm Emanuel - Chief of Staff [Leo McGarry]
Robert Gibbs - White House Press Secretarty [CJ Cregg]
Valerie Jarrett - Senior Advisor, Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs, Public Liason
Jim Messina - Deputy Chief of Staff [Josh Lyman]
Ellen Moran - Communications Director [Toby Ziegler]
Michelle Obama - First Lady [Abbey Bartlet]
Mona Sutphen - Depty Chief of Staff [Josh Lyman]
Barack Obama - President of the United States [Jed Bartlet - or maybe closer to Matt Santos!]

For all the people wondering why Hilary Clinton isn't in here (or any other cabinet members and secretaries), I was thinking about it, but ultimately decided to do it like the show ""The West Wing,"" focusing on the behind the scenes White House staffers rather than cabinet-level members of the government. There were other people I would have liked to feature as well, but there was a lack of pictures or videos of those people. 
I was compelled to make one of the cabinet - but with 14 positions (plus Obama makes 15), that leaves 3 seconds for each person - which wouldn't be enough to make a quality video.  

And I found out that it was shown on MSNBC on Jan. 6, 2009!  Thanks to them for showing (and I'd really appreciate it if anyone has a video of it on TV, if they could post it!)
Also shown on ""Showbiz Tonight"" on CNN HN/HLN, Janurary 16, 2009.  If anyone has a vid of this, I'd appreciate it too!

song: high hopes by Davina Michelle

After the last west wing tribute I made I didn't think i would be able to make another because I felt i had said everything i wanted to say on that one but after the news for the reboot, i felt like i had to try one more time and the moment i decided it this song started playing and i thought, this is it!

I thought about waiting until october 15 and release it on that day but i am too excited and i can not wait. This show taught me a lot and the actors that worked on it keep teaching everyday many, many things. I can not wait for the special we are getting, to see these faces on my screen again and listen to this characters again. 

I hope you will all enjoy this video and be sure to watch the reboot on october 15th.

About The West Wing: 
Cutthroat presidential advisers get their personal lives hopelessly tangled up with professional duties as they try to conduct the business of running a country. Fictional Democratic President Josiah ""Jed"" Bartlet suffers no fools, and that policy alienates many. He and his dedicated staffers struggle to balance the needs of the country with the political realities of Washington, D.C., working through two presidential terms that include countless scandals, threats and political scuffles, as well as the race to succeed Bartlet as the leader of the free world.

"""The West Wing"" Stars Martin Sheen & Melissa Fitzgerald on the Show's Legacy | Amanpour and Company",#NAME?,Amanpour and Company,2024-08-21T21:44:53Z,"Much has been made of DNC 2024's effort to recapture the spirit of Obama's 2008 campaign. But for real political fantasia one must time-travel back to Aaron Sorkin's series ""The West Wing,"" which hit the airwaves in 1999 and seduced viewers with its famous walk and talks, fast-paced scripts and soaring political optimism. A new book now takes us behind the scenes of the hit series: ""Whatâ€™s Next: A Backstage Pass to 'The West Wing,' Its Cast and Crew, and Its Enduring Legacy of Service."" Joining the program is one of the bookâ€™s authors, ""The West Wing"" alumna Melissa Fitzgerald, as well as ""President Bartlet"" himself: award-winning actor Martin Sheen.

Originally aired on August 21, 2024

Lyrics:
3 brothers in a fire
Willing to die for their faith
But You were with them in the fire
And they walked out the next day

And Daniel met a lion
Because he chose to pray 
But You shut the mouth of that lion
And he walked out the next day 

So Whatâ€™s gonna be said of me when itâ€™s all said and done will I stand for my beliefs or will I turn around and run 
Well let the whole world hear me say

Iâ€™m unashamed
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ
And the truth that changed my life
For the Name above all Names
Iâ€™m unashamed 
And I will live my faith out loud
Take a stand and stand my ground
For the One who took my shame 
Iâ€™m unashamed 

I donâ€™t answer to the crowd
I answer to a King
So the louder they shout
Oh the louder I sing
Yeah

Whatâ€™s gonna be said of me when itâ€™s all said and done will I stand for my beliefs or will I turn around and run
Let the whole world hear me say 

Iâ€™m unashamed
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ
And the truth that changed my life
For the Name above all Names
Iâ€™m unashamed 
And I will live my faith out loud
Take a stand and stand my ground
For the One who took my shame 
Iâ€™m unashamed 

At the name of Jesus 
Every knee will bow
And every tongue confess
So let it start right now 

Before you come back Lord
Before the rocks cry out
I will lift my praise  
Let it start right now 

Iâ€™m unashamed
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ
And the truth that changed my life
For the Name above all Names
Iâ€™m unashamed 
Yeah
And I will live my faith out loud
Take a stand and stand my ground
For the One who took my shame 
Iâ€™m unashamed 

Iâ€™m unashamed 

Oh Iâ€™m unashamed (Iâ€™m unashamed)
I want the world to hear me say
Iâ€™m unashamed
Iâ€™m unashamed
Oh
Iâ€™m unashamed
For the One who took my shame
Iâ€™m unashamed

Lord I will stand for You
I tell the world about You
Iâ€™m unashamed

Lyrics:
Be in this world not of it
Follow Jesus, not the crowd 
Be light wherever it looks dark  
And love where hate is loud
Make every dayâ€™s ambition
Be to make my Father proud 
Thatâ€™s my why 

Greet every day with gratitude
Be humble and be kind
See the path in front of you
And leave the past behind 
Between grudges and forgiveness
Choose forgiveness every time
Yeah that's my why

Knowing my Jesus and making Him known
Following Him where He calls me to go
And running this race knowing Iâ€™m running home
Every day of my life
Thatâ€™s my why
Iâ€™m fixing my eyes on a heavenly prize 
So if anyone asks yeah thatâ€™s my why 

Thatâ€™s my why

Lay my life down for my family
But always stand up for my faith
Let my actions speak louder than the words I say
And live like Iâ€™m dying till my dying day
Oh thatâ€™s my why 

Oh 
Knowing my Jesus and making Him known
Following Him where He calls me to go
And running this race knowing Iâ€™m running home
Every day of my life
Thatâ€™s my why
Iâ€™m fixing my eyes on a heavenly prize 
So if anyone asks yeah thatâ€™s my 
Why Iâ€™m living
Why Iâ€™m breathing 
Lord remind me why heart is beating 
Why Iâ€™m living
Why Iâ€™m breathing
Lord remind me why heart is beating 

And when I cross that finish line and my race has been run
May the reasons why I lived my life come down to just this one
To look into my Fatherâ€™s eyes and hear Him say â€œWell doneâ€

Yeah
Thatâ€™s my why

Oh knowing my Jesus and making Him known
(Making Him known)
Following Him where He calls me to go
And running this race knowing Iâ€™m running home
Every day of my life
Thatâ€™s my why
Iâ€™m fixing my eyes on a heavenly prize 
So if anyone asks yeah thatâ€™s my 

Why Iâ€™m living
(Why Iâ€™m living)
Why Iâ€™m breathing 
(Why Iâ€™m breathing)
Lord remind me why heart is beating 

Why Iâ€™m living
Why Iâ€™m breathing
Yeah
If anyone asks 
Yeah 
Thatâ€™s my why

Lyrics:
Dear yesterday
Just called to say Iâ€™m leaving
I made my home there in your shadows far too long

â€˜Cause you never fail
To remind me of all my failures
But I think itâ€™s time that I leave you where you belong  

So goodbye shame
Goodbye past 
Oh goodbye guilty you wonâ€™t see me looking back
Iâ€™m slamming that door 
And Iâ€™m walking away
Hello freedom
Hello mercy
Hello grace 
And goodbye yesterday

Goodbye 
Goodbye
Goodbye

Goodbye 
Goodbye
Goodbye

I met a man named Jesus
Came all the way from heaven to find me 
But thatâ€™s just the start of just how far His love would go 

He took a cross up a hill
Even though it was mine to carry
His blood ran red and washed my sin as white as snow

So goodbye shame
Goodbye past 
Oh goodbye guilty you wonâ€™t see me looking back
Iâ€™m slamming that door 
And Iâ€™m walking away
Hello freedom
Hello mercy
Hello grace 
And goodbye yesterday

Goodbye (woah)
Goodbye (woah)
Goodbye (woah)

Goodbye (woah)
Goodbye (woah)
Goodbye (woah)

Goodbye old me, hello new
Goodbye enemyâ€™s lies, and hello truth
Yeah goodbye broken, oh and hello forgiven
Oh goodbye yesterday, and hello new beginning
Oh yeah

Well goodbye shame
And goodbye past 
Oh goodbye guilty you wonâ€™t see me looking back
No
Iâ€™m slamming that door 
And Iâ€™m walking away
Hello freedom
Hello mercy
Hello grace 
Oh and goodbye yesterday

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Oh yeah

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Goodbye yesterday
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Oh goodbye goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Dear yesterday
Just called to say Iâ€™m leaving

The West Wing is an American political drama television series created by Aaron Sorkin that was originally broadcast on NBC from September 22, 1999, to May 14, 2006.

The series is set primarily in the West Wing of the White House, where the Oval Office and offices of presidential senior personnel are located, during the fictional two-term Democratic administration of President Josiah Bartlet.

The West Wing has been universally regarded among many publications as one of the greatest television shows of all time. It has received praise from critics, political science professors, and former White House staffers and has been the subject of critical analysis. The West Wing received a multitude of accolades, including two Peabody Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and 26 Primetime Emmy Awards, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series, which it won four consecutive times from 2000 to 2003. 

The show's ratings waned in later years following the departure of series creator Sorkin after the fourth season (with him having been the writer or co-writer of 85 of the first 88 episodes), yet it remained popular among high-income viewers, a key demographic for the show and its advertisers, with around 16 million viewers.","#jed bartlet,the west wing,josh lyman,president bartlet",24,0,0,0,PT2M42S,hd,public

Lyrics:
When I go to be with Jesus
It wonâ€™t break my heart to leave
All my worries and my troubles
Will be long gone memories
When that heavenly homecoming
One day comes for me
And I go to be with Jesus
It wonâ€™t break my heart to leave

When I go to be with Jesus
All my tears will be erased
And I trade this song of sorrow 
For a song of endless praise
All the pain and all the sadness
They wonâ€™t make it past the gates
When I go to be with Jesus
Every tear will be erased

With all the ones whoâ€™ve gone before
I stand on that celestial shore
Crying holy holy holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
My knee will bow 
My voice will sing
Worthy is the King of Kings
The One who was and is 
And always will be

When I go to be with Jesus
Every wrong will be made right
Broken hearts and broken bodies
Will be healed in Heavenâ€™s sight
What a blessed restoration 
Waiting on the other side
When I go to be with Jesus
Every wrong will be made right

With all the ones whoâ€™ve gone before
I stand on that celestial shore
Crying holy holy holy 
Is the Lord God Almighty
My knee will bow 
My voice will sing
Worthy is the King of Kings
The One who was and is 
And always will be

When I go to be with Jesus
At last my eyes will see
The Savior who laid down His life 
Just to be with me
From cross to grave to glory
Heâ€™s preparing me a place
â€˜Til then my heart is longing for the day

When I go to be with Jesus
Iâ€™ll know Iâ€™m finally home
When my weary feet are walking on
A street thatâ€™s paved in gold
No this world ain't where Iâ€™m staying
Thereâ€™s somewhere else Iâ€™m meant to go
And when I go to be with Jesus
Iâ€™ll know Iâ€™m finally home

When I go to be with Jesus
Iâ€™ll know Iâ€™m finally home

Lyrics:
When has He ever failed me, not once
When have I ever seen Him let me down
And is there any battle He canâ€™t overcome
And is there any mountain He canâ€™t move right now

I believe that my breakthroughâ€™s coming
I believe that my Godâ€™s not done and
I believe thereâ€™s nothing He canâ€™t do (oh oh oh oh)
I believe thereâ€™s a way Heâ€™s making
Come what may I will not be shaken
On my knees Iâ€™ll stand upon this truth
My breakthroughâ€™s coming

I know Heâ€™s always faithful, always kind
No matter what my circumstances say
And with a story full of miracles behind
Oh I know my miracle is on the way (yeah)

I believe that my breakthroughâ€™s coming
I believe that my Godâ€™s not done and
I believe thereâ€™s nothing He canâ€™t do (oh oh oh oh)
I believe thereâ€™s a way Heâ€™s making
Come what may I will not be shaken
On my knees Iâ€™ll stand upon this truth
My breakthroughâ€™s coming

I will see the walls falling
I will see the waves parted
Heâ€™s just getting started
Breakthroughâ€™s coming, breakthroughâ€™s coming
I will see the doors open
I will see the stone rolling
Oh I know that I know it
Breakthroughâ€™s coming, breakthroughâ€™s coming

I will see the walls falling
I will see the waves parted
Heâ€™s just getting started
Breakthroughâ€™s coming, breakthroughâ€™s coming
I will see the doors open
I will see the stone rolling
Oh I know that I know it
Breakthroughâ€™s coming, breakthroughâ€™s coming

I believe that my breakthroughâ€™s coming
I believe that my Godâ€™s not done and
I believe thereâ€™s nothing He canâ€™t do (oh oh oh oh)
(Nothing He can not do)
I believe thereâ€™s a way Heâ€™s making
Come what may I will not be shaken
(I will not be shaken)
On my knees Iâ€™ll stand upon this truth
My breakthroughâ€™s coming
Itâ€™s coming

I believe my breakthroughâ€™s coming
Itâ€™s coming
My breakthroughâ€™s coming

Born on December 27, 1939, in Newark, New Jersey, Amos initially pursued a career in professional football before transitioning to acting. He earned a sociology degree from Colorado State University and worked as a social worker prior to his acting career[1][4]. His son, K.C. Amos, expressed heartfelt condolences, noting that his father was loved by fans who regarded him as their television father[2][3].

Amos's impact on television and film is profound; he also appeared in notable projects such as **The Mary Tyler Moore Show**, **Coming to America**, and **The West Wing**. His legacy includes not only his memorable performances but also his commitment to portraying authentic Black experiences on screen[1][5][6].

JFK: Mildred Stegall,SN6C0HKiB9Q,Out Of The Blank,2024-10-02T23:24:22Z,"Mildred Stegall worked in the White House during Johnson's presidency and served as the liaison between the White House and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Mildred was a right-hand woman to LBJ and the one who saved his presidency, warts and all, by securing his secret White House telephone recordings in a West Wing vault only she could open. Mildred paints a complicated picture of LBJ by discussing his outrageous behavior and attitude to his staff while also revealing his caring side in regards to people like her that stood by him.

Her release to the LBJ library has revealed much of these complexities

Travel back to Victorian Lincoln at Priory Gate,MgvEPOcag_Y,Light and Dreams Photography,2024-10-04T08:30:21Z,"This time shift video finds us uphill in the historic heart of Lincoln looking at Priory Gate, with the Cathedral out of shot to the left.

The old photo is from the 1890s, and you can see Eastgate House in the background where the Lincoln Hotel now stands. Eastgate House was built around 1750, and had many owners before being bought in 1888 by Alfred Shuttleworth. He added the west wing, which ironically is the only part of the house remaining today. Shuttleworth went on to cause great controversy in about 1892, when he bought the row of houses opposite, including the popular Dolphin Inn, and demolished them to improve his view of the Cathedral. So the old photo must post date that. The main part of Eastgate House was demolished in the early 1960s, and replaced by the Eastgate (now the Lincoln) Hotel. The new hotel incorporated the old west wing building into it.

Priory Gate itself isn't as old as most people think. It is a an early 19th century replacement for medieval gates that originally stood on this site, and the modern arch was assembled from the medieval building material. A similar gateway arch stands at the south end of Pottergate, and Exchequer Gate, a true medieval survivor, stands near the cathedral west front. A few short steps away from Priory Gate, off to the left, is a statue of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a Lincolnshire native, erected in 1905.

The Grade II listed gateway has a central pointed arch flanked by a pair of small pedestrian arches. The top of the gateway is crenellated in the fashion of a medieval castle parapet. The original gate was one of a pair over the road on the east side of the Cathedral grounds, the second gate being closer to the junction with Eastgate a few yards to the north.

Both gates were torn down in 1815, and the solitary Priory Gate erected in 1825 using as many of the original stones as possible.","lincoln,lincolnshire,england,britain,uk,priory gate,minster yard,cathedral,eastgate house,medieval,archway,cathedral close,1890s,1825,early 19th century,alfred shuttleworth,georgian,lincoln hotel,traffic lights,road junction,eastgate,then and now,history,time shift,time travel,uphill,historic quarter,stone built,wall,houses,crenallations,trees,photography,nikon,sigma,height restriction,monochrome,black and white,entrance,steps,demolished,developments,road sign",22,86,15,0,PT46S,hd,public

Remembering John Amos: The Iconic 'Good Times' Star Who Shaped TV History!,HMjTW6p2qzo,AMAZING BLACK HERITAGE,2024-10-02T04:22:33Z,"John Amos, Beloved â€˜Good Timesâ€™ Patriarch and Emmy Nominee, Passes Away at 84

John Amos, renowned for his role as the family patriarch in the iconic 1970s sitcom â€œGood Timesâ€ and an Emmy nominee for the groundbreaking miniseries â€œRoots,â€ has died at the age of 84. He passed away on August 21 in Los Angeles from natural causes, as confirmed by his publicist.

Amos portrayed James Evans Sr. on â€œGood Times,â€ which showcased one of televisionâ€™s first Black two-parent families. The show, produced by Norman Lear and co-created by Mike Evans, aired on CBS from 1974 to 1979. Amos once remarked to Time magazine that the show depicted African American life authentically.

His film career included appearances in â€œLetâ€™s Do It Again,â€ â€œComing to America,â€ and â€œUncut Gems,â€ among others. He was also featured in Ice Cube and Dr. Dreâ€™s 1994 music video â€œNatural Born Killaz.â€

James Evans, alongside his wife Florida, portrayed by Esther Rolle, originated from Learâ€™s â€œMaude.â€ James often worked multiple jobs to support his three children, with Jimmie Walker becoming a breakout star as J.J.

The showâ€™s cultural influence extended to music, with artists like Alicia Keys and the Wu-Tang Clan referencing Amos and his character in their lyrics. His son, Kelly Christopher Amos, expressed that many fans considered his father their TV dad, stating, â€œHe lived a good life... His legacy will live on.â€

Amos and Rolle aimed to present a positive representation of a Black family facing challenges in a Chicago public housing project. However, they grew frustrated with the portrayal of Walker's character and the direction of the show. After three successful seasons, Amos was let go due to his criticism of the showâ€™s writing, which he felt was inauthentic.

Despite the challenges, Amos rebounded with his role as Kunta Kinte in â€œRoots,â€ a pivotal moment in his career that earned him recognition and acclaim, including an Emmy nomination. He described this role as transformative, providing a profound reflection of his experiences as an actor.

John Amos was born on December 27, 1939, in Newark, New Jersey. He graduated from Colorado State University with a sociology degree and initially pursued a career in social work before transitioning to acting. He started his television journey as Gordy Howard on â€œThe Mary Tyler Moore Showâ€ and later appeared in numerous series, including â€œThe West Wingâ€ and â€œTwo and a Half Men.â€

In 2020, he was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. Amos is survived by his daughter Shannon and son Kelly Christopher, both from his first marriage to Noel Mickelson. His second marriage to actress Lillian Lehman also ended in divorce.","John Amos,Good Times,Roots,Emmy Nominee,TV History,Black Television,Sitcom Legends,James Evans,Esther Rolle,1970s TV,African American Actors,Hollywood Tribute,Television Legacy,Classic Sitcoms,Kunta Kinte,Norman Lear,Iconic Roles,Film Career,TV Father,Pop Culture Impact,Rest in Peace John Amos,John Amos Tribute,New Jersey Hall of Fame,Remembering John Amos,John Amos death,John Amos died,Father from good times dead died",25,2373,N/A,N/A,PT41S,hd,public

Melissa Fitzgerald and Mary McCormack â€¢ Whatâ€™s Next: A Backstage Pass to The West Wing,X-xHkoKXhqc,Rancho Mirage Library & Observatory,2024-10-02T10:22:43Z,"Melissa Fitzgerald is an actor, producer and social justice advocate. As an actor, Fitzgerald is best known for her seven-year role as Carol on the award-winning television series The West Wing. While in Hollywood, Fitzgerald cofounded Voices in Harmony, a mentoring program that uses theater to work with historically underserved teens. In 2013, she left Hollywood to champion justice system reform at All Rise, where she is at the forefront of engaging the public in the expansion of treatment courts and advancing justice system responses for individuals impacted by substance use and mental health disorders. 

Mary McCormack is an actor, producer and activist. A Tony-nominated Broadway actress, she is known for diverse range of roles across film, television and theater. McCormack is an outspoken advocate for a whole host of causes, from social justice and womenâ€™s rights to veteransâ€™ issues and criminal justice reform. She lives in Los Angeles. 

This fall marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the much beloved TV series The West Wing, which is consistently ranked among the best television shows of all time and still has legions of adoring fans. During its initial run of seven seasons on NBC between 1999 and 2006, it attracted tens of millions of viewers and racked up many awards, including two Peabodys, three Golden Globes and twenty-six primetime Emmys. The 2016 election of Donald Trump spiked a fresh surge in viewership on streaming platforms that continues to this day. 

Whatâ€™s Next offers an exclusive behind-the-scenes look into The West Wingâ€™s creation and legacy, with a particular emphasis on the showâ€™s commitment to service that was embodied not only in the cast membersâ€™ devotion to different causes, which is still ongoing, but also with the strong bonds of friendship and feeling of family that made being part of the show so special and that still endure to this day. In a critical election year and at a time when politics are as turbulent and polarizing as they may have ever been, Fitzgerald and McCormack reground us in The West Wingâ€™s nostalgic, aspirational White House. A wide-ranging and inspirational book that spotlights a variety of organizations supported by members of the cast and crew through their own â€œservice stories,â€ Whatâ€™s Next is, according to the authors, â€œa love letter to The West Wing, the people who made it, and the fans who loved it.â€ 

Thank you to RMWF Platinum Angel Jordan Schnitzer, who made a generous donation to support the Writers Series funded by the Harold & Arlene Schnitzer CARE Foundation.

Fitzgerald and McCormack will speak with Justice Douglas Miller, a justice for the Fourth District Court of Appeals.

This series is made possible by a generous gift from the Rancho Mirage Writers Festival Foundation.",,24,311,9,N/A,PT1H10M1S,hd,public
Kingdom tower vlog! Riyadh tower! saudia arabia tallest tower in riyadh !vlog kingdom tower,qpshPn041yQ,Peshawar Reaction,2024-09-29T19:10:55Z,"Kingdom Centre (Arabic: Ù…Ø±ÙƒØ² Ø§Ù„Ù…Ù…Ù„ÙƒØ©), formerly Kingdom Tower, is a 99-story, 302.3 m (992 ft) skyscraper in the al-Olaya district of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. When completed in 2002, it overtook the 267-meter (876 ft) Faisaliyah Tower as the tallest tower in Saudi Arabia. It has since been surpassed and, as of 2021, is the fifth-tallest skyscraper in the country, whose tallest two buildings are the Abraj Al Bait Towers and the Capital Market Authority Tower. It is the world's third-tallest building with a hole after the Shanghai World Financial Center and the 85 Sky Tower in Taiwan. It contains the King Abdullah Mosque, which is the world's most elevated mosque from ground level.

The tower was developed by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal,[5] and designed by the team of Ellerbe Becket and Omrania, who were selected through an international design competition.[6] It is situated on a 100,000â€“square-metre site and houses the 57,000-square-meter Al-Mamlaka shopping mall, offices, the Four Seasons Hotel Riyadh,[7] and luxury apartments. There is a 65m skybridge atop the skyscraper.[8][9]

The upper third of the tower features an inverted parabolic arch topped by a public sky bridge.[9] The sky bridge is a 300-ton steel structure, taking the form of an enclosed corridor with windows on both sides. After paying the admission fees, visitors take two elevators to reach that level.[10]

Design
The Kingdom Centre was designed by the US-based architecture firm Ellerbe Becket in a joint venture with the Riyadh-based architecture and engineering firm Omrania and Associates. The building is composed of a tower and a podium comprising two symmetrical wings. The tower's almond-shaped plan and curving forms gives the building a distinctive shape that helps keep it cool, with the narrow ends facing the east and west where heat gain is greatest. A high-performance curtain wall, made from silver, butt-jointed reflective glazing, also helps control heat gain while concealing the three main mechanical floors to create a seamless facade.[9]

At the top of the tower, an inverted arch is spanned by a glass skybridge housing a public observation deck.[11] The large opening allows the building to rise higher than the height limitâ€”30 occupied floorsâ€”mandated by local laws. Its design was inspired by iconic structures from around the world, including the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, The Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the Eiffel Tower.[12]

From base to top, the tower house 13 floors of offices, 10 stories of hotel, five stories of luxury apartments, and additional office space at the top.[13] The East wing of the podium houses the Al-Mamlaka shopping mall, which features more than 150 stores divided across three levels - the first targeted to young people, the second to fashion and furnishings, and the third level is reserved for women.[14] The West wing houses event and entertainment spaces.

Structure
The Kingdom Center is built on a four-meter-thick, 3,100-square-meter raft foundation.[15] Its structure consists of two systems: reinforced concrete columns, beams, and core for the first 180 meters, and a tubular steel frame structure for the building's remaining height.[9][15]

Mechanical systems
A multi-part mechanical system was created to accommodate the building's mixed-use program. The tower is cooled by a central chilled water plant, supported by a thermal energy storage system that provides 5,000 tons of cooling capacity. This storage system is used during the hottest hours of the day, allowing the building to shift cool-air production to off-peak hours when electrical demand is lowest.[12]

The podium structures are served by separate mechanical systems designed to accommodate the needs of the building's unique programs. Systems used to cool these spaces include variable air volume, constant volume, and fan coils.[12]","KINGDOM TOWER,kingdom tower riyadh,kingdom tower vlog,visit kingdom tower,saudi kingdom tower,saudi arabia tower project,the kingdom tower saudi arabia,tallest tower in riyad,kingdom tower tallest,video on kingdom tower,best vlog on kingdom tower,kingdom tower,riyadh season 2024,saudi ka kingdom tower,saudi arabia kingdom tower,kingdom tower saudi arabia,kingdom tower riyadhisit,visit to kingdom,kingdom,tower,tower building,saudi,arabia,riyadh,ksa,saudia a",22,56,0,0,PT10M10S,hd,public
