https://ZYXDance.lnk.to/SynthesizerLegends

The album is still available for a limited time on vinyl!
https://kebu.bandcamp.com/

I always liked this tune and was inspired when I heard Michael Cassette's version. So for my live performance I made an arrangement that was influenced by both versions, but put my own twist on it. The tune ended my show in Dynamo, Turku, where this video was recorded 5th May 2012. Unfortunately, I only had three camcorders going and the heavy bass drum in the club made the cameras vibrate with each beat. But the feeling was so high in the club that I definitely wanted to upload this particular take! 

The song was performed using only analog synthesizers, either played live or sequenced. The performance was recorded line in to one of the cameras. The ambience in the club was recorded using the built-in microphones on two of the remaining cameras and mixed together with the line signal. Some mistakes were replaced with audio from a rehearsal take.

Equipment used in this song: Korg Polysix, Poly 61 (through a SansAmp GT2), Mono/Poly, Micro-preset M500; Roland TR-808, Jomox AirBase99, Juno 60, Alpha Juno 1&2; Touched-by-sound DRM1, Oberheim Matrix 6R, Yamaha RM1x (only for MIDI sequencing), Behringer DDX3216, Lexicon MPX500, as well as a midi patchbay and additional preamps for my mixer. Cameras: Canon HF100 (x2) and HF200.

A big thank you to the amazing audience in Turku and to Turku Synth Club for arranging the gig!

The adventures of the vice squad detectives of the Miami Police Department.

Stubble-faced detective Crockett lived in a sailboat guarded by his alligator Elvis. His partner Tubbs was a black New York cop looking for his brother's killer. Together they took on the Florida drug world. The show influenced men's fashions toward Italo-casual and interior decor toward the Memphis look. Very trendy music and unusual guest performers.

Well if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
Ive seen your face before my friend
But i dont know if you know who i am
Well i was there and i saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe of the grin
I know where youve been
Its all been a pack of lies

I can feel it

Well i remember
I remember dont worry
How could i ever forget
Its the first time
The last time 
We ever met
But i know the reason why you keep me silenced up
No you dont fool me
Cause the hurt doesnt show
But the pain still grows
Its no stranger to you and me

Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell go deep undercover in the explosive, action-packed Miami Vice that ""sets fire to the screen"" (James Verniere, Boston Herald). When detectives Ricardo Tubbs (Foxx) and Sonny Crockett (Farrell) are asked to investigate the brutal murders of two federal agents, they find themselves pulled into the alluring and lethal world of drug traffickers. Michael Mann's Miami Vice is ""sleek, powerful, dark and dangerous"" (Geoff Pevere, Toronto Star).

It was predominantly fueled by the illegal trafficking of cocaine. Much of Miami's drug trafficking activity was centered out of Coconut Grove's Mutiny at Sailboat Bay, where drug traffickers would frequently meet and conduct business. By 1981 crime in Miami had become so rampant from the cocaine trade that journalist Roben Farzad argues Miami was a failed state. During the time major traffickers like the Falcon brothers and Sal Magluta smuggled in around 2 billion dollars of cocaine from Colombia. Miami soon became known as the ""Drug Capital of the World""

I just finished binge watching all 5 seasons of Miami Vice. WHAT A SHOW. No idea what I've been missing. I made my own list of the top ""obscure"" episodes of Miami Vice: http://lopezvideo.net/blog/12/16/2017

But there's one episode that didn't make it on the list...

A Bullet for Crockett. The reason is simple: it's the 2nd worse episode in the entire show (the winner goes to ""Leap of Faith""). But that INTRO scene - holy shit!

That intro scene is my #1 favorite scene in the entire season. It's got tension, fate, sex, life, death, pop, urban, nothing, everything, PERFECT! This is how you cinema. 

PS: This show is universally iconic for its use of Phil Collins's ""In The Air Tonight"" in its pilot episode ""Brother's Keeper"" (Season 01 Episode 01). But what most people don't know is that the song is used for a second time in the series... In this episode, in this scene. And in my opinion, *THIS* is the defining / iconic use of the song... Not the pseudo-romantic fragment-poem bullshit they tried to pull off in the first episode, which caught on for some reason (I guess people really love shots of cars driving at night in a neon-glowing city...)

Yeah, most people think it's not a good picture, some even use the word poor. We think it's because it's not light and shallow as most action movies are. It's dark and leaves things unsolved. No real plastic heroes, just real cops who go through the difficulties of working undercover.

This is possibly due to NBC censors demanding ""equal arms"" for both men, that Hackman (being the sneaky bad-guy he is) could have had a gun hidden under his book, or that Sonny plants the gun to make it look like Hackman committed suicide. In the scene directly preceding Hackman's death, Sonny is shown strapping a ""throw away gun"" to his calf under his pant leg.
Sheena Easton's final song, ""Follow My Rainbow"", appeared on her album The Lover In Me, released in 1989. 
Crockett's attitude in this episode, following Caitlin's death, is just like Tubbs' attitude following Angelina's death in Sons and Lovers. In both cases, they appear depressed and unwilling to listen to anyone (even their own partner). Both characters also eventually take revenge on those responsible. ..
""Deliver Us From Evil"", passages from The Lord's Prayer.
When he executes Hackman, Don Johnson does not even blink in reaction to the gunshot, a very unusual thing for an actor to be able to do.
SO Hackman kills the light person and lines up his laser rifle, thinks about killing Crockett, but due to his belief that Crockett killed his wife, Hackman fires and kills Caitlin in Crockett's arms. 
Crockett, drowning his sorrows in some whiskey  surrounded by pictures of Caitlin, finds the cross Hackman gave him when he got off Death Row two years earlier, then Tubbs stops by just as Crockett gets a phone call from the M.E., which Tubbs takes, to let him know Caitlin was seven weeks pregnant (which is what she tried to tell Crockett but was never able to), which sends Crockett into a drunken rage and storms off the boat. Three weeks later, Crockett is still on the boat, cleaning & polishing everything on it (and still drowning his sorrows in whiskey), blowing off Tubbs' efforts to talk to him. Back at OCB, they found Blatt had gone back to Chicago but is returning to Miami that night, and Crockett returns to work a day early. Hackman checked into the Virgin Gordor under the name ""Crockett"", previously he was in Martinique. Castillo returns his transfer request, unsigned, saying he thought he'd want to review it first. Crockett & Tubbs hit Blatt's house (before he can kill Julia) and take him in. He gives up Hackman, currently on Caicos Island, though arranging extradition may be a problem. Castillo wants Crockett to get some rest, which he does, on Caicos Island where he faces Hackman. Hackman tells Crockett how he set up his retirement home, including how he made arrangements with the local judge and police about their pensions, and refuses Crockett's demands to ""get up"". Crockett then gives Hackman his cross back, then pulls out his gun, Hackman tells Crockett he knows how the same way he couldn't let an innocent man be executed, he knows he can't shoot an unarmed man, he then closes his eyes and lays his head back. Crockett shoots Hackman dead, and calmly walks away, and as he does we see a gun in the dead Hackman's hand.

Two words: Miami Vice. So in-between watching GTA 6 trailer breakdowns, why not learn how this stylish police procedural spread its vast influence echoes across our culture, entertainment and civilization for decades? From Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Vice City Stories, Hotline Miami, Drive (2011), Burn Notice, the Outrun movement, mallsoft music, and countless other works.

And while most only know it for white suits and funny haircuts, the show is much more than it initially lets on. And unlike most TV series, this work of fiction helped transform the Miami-Dade area from a crime-addled slum to a booming party town, famous for its music and tourism scene.

Rockstar Games also showcases the stunning Vice City in their highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI!

Let's delve into the cultural, societal and media influence of Miami Vice.

And now for a totally different adventure...video editing! I have a project planned with the song/footage but for now, here's the original. This sequence is one of the reasons I got into attaching my GoPro to my gear and filming it.

From Miami Vice Season 1, Episode 1 (Pilot) Brother's Keeper which was a two-part premiere (1 hour 30 minute runtime) which originally aired on Sept. 16, 1984.

I don't own the rights to the song or video other than my personal purchase of each.

LYRICS / LETRA

Cuando toâ€™ parece perdido empiezo a ganar
Salgo en busca de eso
Del Ã©xtasis que me haga calmar
Perdido en la Miami Vice
Salgo en busca de eso
Del Ã©xtasis que me de la paz

No se que va a pasar maÃ±ana
Puede que toque el cielo o que caiga al suelo
Tengo a esa droga dÃ¡ndome celos
Y la maldita es como la fama
Hoy esta conmigo y se va maÃ±ana
Caigo a su cama y es mas que sexo
Pero yo se como es el proceso
No deberÃ­a creerme toâ€™ eso

Salgo verificaoâ€™ 
En el club me siento Pacqiao
Invencible sin nadie al lado
En Miami y sali del prado
El futuro lo hemos pactaoâ€™ 
Me cruce para el otro lado
Voy de lentes y ojos tapados 
Caminando sobre la oscuridad

Cuando toâ€™ parece perdido empiezo a ganar
Salgo en busca de eso
Del Ã©xtasis que me haga calmar
Perdido en la Miami Vice
Salgo en busca de eso
Del Ã©xtasis que me de la paz

Cuando toâ€™ parece perdido empiezo a ganar
Salgo en busca de eso
Del Ã©xtasis que me haga calmar
Perdido en la Miami Vice
Salgo en busca de eso
Del Ã©xtasis que me de la paz

Joseando de dia
No he tenido un dÃ­a tranquilo
La ansiedad me sigue ganando
Voy por el Downtown con estilo de Paris
Del estadio la estamos sacando

Esta vaina es muy superficial
Mi vacÃ­o no creo que puedan sacarlo
Pero este juego es asÃ­
Esto lo elegÃ­, no me estoy quejando

Salgo verificaoâ€™ 
En el club me siento Pacqiao
Invencible sin nadie al lado
En Miami y sali del prado
El futuro lo hemos pactaoâ€™ 
Me cruce para el otro lado
Voy de lentes y ojos tapados
Caminando sobre la oscuridad

Cuando toâ€™ parece perdido empiezo a ganar
Salgo en busca de eso
Del Ã©xtasis que me haga calmar
Perdido en la Miami Vice
Salgo en busca de eso
Del Ã©xtasis que me de la paz

Cuando toâ€™ parece perdido empiezo a ganar
Salgo en busca de eso
Del Ã©xtasis que me haga calmar
Perdido en la Miami Vice
Salgo en busca de eso
Del Ã©xtasis que me de la paz

Song starts at 0:44

This episode is special in that it features Sonny's new ride, a 1986 Ferrari Testarossa (my personal favorite) after his previous ""Ferrari"" (was actually a Corvette with a body kit) was destroyed with a Stinger missile. You know, like typically happens every day 😆. That means this is the first REAL Ferrari Sonny drives on a regular basis. If you're wondering why that is... it's because it took Ferrari 3 years to realize what a hit the show was and since they were already driving a pseudo-Ferrari, the company thought it best to provide them with a real one for promotional reasons. You can guarantee there were cars sold because of that move.

Another fun fact about this scene is it features the song ""When The Rain Comes Down"" by Andy Taylor, which was recorded exclusively for Miami Vice and was only available on the soundtrack titled ""Miami Vice II"" which featured a number of songs from the show. You may know Andy Taylor from the hit 80s group Duran Duran. After leaving the group in 1986, he began working on a solo career. This song proceeds his first solo album ""Thunder"" which released in 1987.

As for why I uploaded this video to my channel... I basically just really like the car and the driving footage but I also noticed a lack of the video with the original scene on YouTube and figured I'd add it. I don't own the rights to the song or video beyond my own personal purchase of the DVD. This video is not made for profit. Just entertainment. Thanks for watching.

ABOUT MIAMI VICE:
Starring Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, created by Anthony Yerkovich and produced by Michael Mann, ""Miami Vice"" focused on the Miami Police Department's vice squad and its efforts to end drug trafficking and prostitution. Centered on the unlikely partnership of Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs - who first meet when Tubbs is undercover in a drug cartel - the series ran for five seasons on NBC, from 1984 to 1990. It was both influenced by and a great influence on the popular culture of the time, making use of new wave and other current music as well as introducing the U.S. to the colorful and laid-back styles of Italian men's fashion.

No show ever as perfectly encapsulated its era as Miami: Vice, which merged the music and style of MTV with a hardcore police procedural, with none other than Michael Mann as its showrunner. It made icons out of its two stars, Don Johnson as Sonny Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Rico Tubbs, and ran for five seasons. Are all of them winners? No. Once Michael Mann left in season three, things got uneven, but as we'll show you in our latest installment of ""Gone But Not Forgotten"" - when this show was good it was great! So pop ""In The Air Tonight"" into the Spotify playlist, slip on some loafers and enjoy!

LYRIC / LETRA
Tuve que quedarme solo porque solo estoy mejor
Lo poco que me quedaba se lo llevo la anterior
Ya le di mi corazÃ³n a un par y siempre fue un error
Pero despuÃ©s de la lluvia siempre sale el resplandor

Salimos de safari
Flow caro like Bugatti
En la carretera high speed
Dentro de mi vaso ice tea
Pero no te voy a mentir
Siempre que bebo me dan ganas de volver a escribir
O de volverle a hacer un call
Pero seguimos en cruise control
Todas tus promesas me las enrole y me las fume adentro de un blunt
Cocinando materia prima no importa la hora ni el clima
Tengo que hacer money para la flia
No puedo perderme en las drugs
No puedo perder mi cabeza en las hoes

Me tuve que quedar solo porque solo estoy mejor
Lo poco que me quedaba se lo llevo la anterior
Ya le di mi corazÃ³n a un par y siempre fue un error
Pero despuÃ©s de la lluvia siempre sale el resplandor

Lo poco que me quedaba se lo llevo la anterior
Ya le di mi corazÃ³n a un par y siempre fue un error
Pero despuÃ©s de la lluvia siempre sale el resplandor

Cuando toâ€™ parece perdido empiezo a ganar
Salgo en busca de eso del extasis que me haga calmar
Perdido en la Miami Vice
Salgo en busca de eso del extasis que me haga calmar

Par de meses leyendo las criticas
Me encerrÃ© a renovar todas las tÃ¡cticas
Me encerrÃ© a renovar todas las barras
Mi flow esta intacto eso viene de fabrica
Mis ojos estÃ¡n bien abiertos reciÃ©n salimos de la Ã³ptica
La movie en Miami no para, sin tener la fama mujeres exÃ³ticas

Me tuve que quedar solo porque solo estoy mejor
Lo poco que me quedaba se lo llevo la anterior
Ya le di mi corazÃ³n a un par y siempre fue un error
Pero despuÃ©s de la lluvia siempre sale el resplandor

Lo poco que me quedaba se lo llevo la anterior
Ya le di mi corazÃ³n a un par y siempre fue un error

When he took over as Lt. Castillo on 'Miami Vice,' Edward James Olmos had a completely different idea about playing his character. Edward James Olmos transformed the character of Lt. Castillo on “Miami Vice,” bringing a stark contrast to his predecessor, Lt. Rodriguez.

Olmos insisted on a minimalist office for Castillo, removing all items except a bottle of aspirin, to reflect the character’s personality. Olmos and Don Johnson had a standoff over whether Castillo’s office door should be open or closed, which ultimately added to the on-screen tension.

Olmos maintained a distant demeanor towards other characters for the first 10 episodes to enhance the tension and authenticity of his role.",PT5M59S,3498.0,public,2024-09-25T17:24:43Z,,I didn’t look at Crockett for 10 episodes,368321.0,True,2025-12-09,2025-12-09

Owing to Miami’s extensive waterways and close relationship with the ocean, Crockett’s undercover work often led to the need for high-speed transportation over water. Drug dealers in the city also often utilize offshore boats for their smuggling operations, and the best way to combat them was to issue undercover Vice officers with their own powerboats.

Doch jetzt isses wieder da, nur der Kilometerzähler
 Der ist jetzt frisiert, wie'n Irokesenträger
 Und die Farbe ist neu plus paar neue Teile
 Doch ey du kriegst es zurück, ich mach dir 'n Freundschaftspreis
 Denn nach der Downloadkrise und all den Raubkopien
 Dacht ich: Warum nicht mal Autoschieben ausprobieren?
 Ey yo Kid, ich werd vom Schnauzbart tragenden Streifenpolizisten
 Durchsucht, während ich im ausladenden Maybach Cockpit sitze
 Das so groß ist wie ein Einfamilienwohnhaus
 Ey erst stoßen sie bei der Leibesvisitation auf
 Kleinkaliberpatronen, brauchen nicht mehr lang
 Dann finden sie die Gun
 Und die 30 Kilogramm Koks auch
 Doch ey, nachdem sie erst erkannt haben wer ich bin Rap ich hier nochn kurzen Doubletime auf die Mailbox und sie wünschen mir gute Fahrt und gehn. Yeah

Heute seid ihr G's, früher habt ihr Eko gehört
 Steig ein fahre, ich will Drive-by starten
 Und werd hoch angesehen wie die Freiheitsstatue

 Doch es war knapp wie das Outfit deiner Mutter
 Als sie draußen vor dem Club stand mit all ihren Weibern
Da war sie Geil wie Van Damme in Street Fighter
Im Block zugeschlagen du bis Stockschwul wie (Laas)
Ich zwinge Studentinnen Kopftuch zu tragen. Yeah

Ja in jungen Jahren war ich Langfinger wie E.T. Yeah

This week, we are taking a look at a more recent film, 2006’s MIAMI VICE. For those of you who know anything about me, you know my love for Michael Mann’s classic 1980s television series runs deep. The saga of Crockett and Tubbs is an instantly recognizable archive of a decade of excess, fluorescent clothing, rolled up sport coats, and amazing hair. Running for five seasons on NBC, MIAMI VICE drew heavily on New Wave culture and has remained a syndication stalwart for thirty years. Having influenced everything from video games like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City to the storytelling format of police procedurals like Law & Order, Miami Vice returned to the mainstream in the early 2000s with series creator Michael Mann behind the camera. Only, this big screen MIAMI VICE is virtually nothing like the television series it was based on - or so it would seem.

Since the lackluster box office of $63.5 million domestically (plus another $100 million internationally) and divisive critical reception, Miami Vice faded pretty quickly but the stories of the troublesome production have abounded. But how is the film itself, fifteen years after the fact? Join us as we examine this much maligned but awesome Michael Mann, Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx classic.

This is a remastered and ""re-extended"" version of the theme of the TV show ""Miami Vice"" by Jan Hammer (1986). Re-Extended because it has already been officially extended for the 12'' vinyl. However the official extended version was ""only"" 6'54''. So, I did more... I have remastered it from the original vinyl in ultra high quality (24bits/192khz). There's NO LOOP! I mixed up the 3 different versions that were available on the vinyl: Original, Remix & Extended Remix.

AaRE3nQXIi4,24,UC5KD40UCDRUbR-od7sp9cuA,Collider Interviews,307.0,hd,"Loaded with unequivocal success, award-winning actor Don Johnson’s career is filled equally with stone-cold classics and contemporary blockbusters. He won a Golden Globe for his iconic portrayal of Sonny Crockett in Miami Vice. He’s had a top Billboard single off of his charting album Heartbeat. He lit the stage as Guys & Dolls’ Nathan Detroit in London’s prestigious West End. He smashed onto the scene with a second seminal television show, Nash Bridges. He’s filmed fruitful collaborations with massive directors like Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, Rian Johnson, and so many more. Now he’s adding Rebel Ridge, the new film by Blue Ruin’s thriller auteur filmmaker Jeremy Saulnier, to his filmography.

Rebel Ridge is set in the town of Shelby Springs. After Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) tries to post bail for his cousin, his savings are unjustly seized by corrupt local police Chief Sandy Burnne, played with pitch-perfect intensity by Johnson. With the help of court clerk Summer McBride (AnnaSophia Robb), Terry unearths a widespread conspiracy within Shelby Springs and sets off to get his money back by any means necessary.

Collider’s Steven Weintraub sat down with Don Johnson to discuss humanity in villains, what it’s like rehearsing with Oscar-winning directors, and the reality of shooting over 20 episodes of Miami Vice each season.

By hiring IPSC and USPSA shooters as well as shooters of various other disciplines as technical advisors, the guns of Miami Vice had an authenticity and cool factor all their own. Case in point is this Colt 1911 MK IV Series 80 Government model used on the series that underwent significant custom modifications by Richard Heinie. 

Not only was the pistol featured on Miami Vice, and wielded by Liam Neeson, it even made the front cover of American Handgunner Magazine.

This May, Rock Island Auction Company will offer this Richard Heinie custom long slide 1911.

According to Liquor.com the Miami Vice cocktail predates the popular 80s television show of the same name. The cocktail is known as a club cocktail or resort cocktail - it has typical beachy vibes about it, from the ingredients to its presentation.

It's simply a mash up of two classic cocktails, the Strawberry Daiquiri and the Pina Colada, poured separately yet in the same glass to create a colourful layered effect. The best part of this cocktail is you have multiple consumption options - drink the tart Strawberry Daiquiri, sip the creamy, coconut-y Pina Coalda or mix them together for a mish mash of two excellent frozen drinks!

Together, let's ensure the uninterrupted flow of soothing sounds into your lives. Every contribution, no matter the size, resonates deeply with our commitment to provide you with the best ambient experience.

Emitida durante cinco temporadas en NBC, MIAMI VICE se inspirÃ³ en gran medida en la cultura New Wave y ha permanecido como un pilar de la sindicaciÃ³n durante treinta aÃ±os. Habiendo influenciado todo, desde videojuegos como Grand Theft Auto: Vice City hasta el formato narrativo de los procedimientos policiales como Law & Order, Miami Vice regresÃ³ a la corriente principal a principios de los 2000 con el creador de la serie, Michael Mann, detrÃ¡s de la cÃ¡mara. Solo que esta versiÃ³n cinematogrÃ¡fica de MIAMI VICE es prÃ¡cticamente nada como la serie de televisiÃ³n en la que se basaba - o eso parece.

Desde la mediocre taquilla de $63.5 millones en Estados Unidos (mÃ¡s otros $100 millones a nivel internacional) y la recepciÃ³n crÃ­tica divisiva, Miami Vice se desvaneciÃ³ bastante rÃ¡pido, pero las historias sobre la problemÃ¡tica producciÃ³n han abundado. Pero, Â¿cÃ³mo es la pelÃ­cula en sÃ­, mÃ¡s de quince aÃ±os despuÃ©s? Ãšnanse a nosotros mientras examinamos este muy criticado pero impresionante clÃ¡sico de Michael Mann, Colin Farrell y Jamie Foxx.

How To Make the Classic Miami Vice
For the PiÃ±a Colada
1.5 oz White Rum
2 oz Fresh Pineapple juice
0.75 oz Coconut syurp*
0.75 oz Coconut milk (full fat means about 15%)

1.5 oz Rum
0.75 oz Lime juice
0.75 oz Simple syrup
6-8 Strawberries
3 Drops Saline solution
1/8 tsp Xanthan gum
150 gr Ice

* To make the Coconut Syrup, simply mix equal parts of sugar and full-fat coconut milk in a saucepan and heat until the sugar is dissolved, stirring constantly. Remove from heat as soon as the sugar is dissolved to reduce evaporation and prevent unbalancing the syrup.

2 oz or 60 ml Unsweetened organic Coconut water
2 oz or 60 ml Coconut Syrup
1 oz or 30 ml Lime juice
6 Drops 20% Saline solution
2 oz or 60 ml Coconut Milk (Full fat)

Mix all ingredients except for the coconut milk in one container.
In another container, add the coconut milk and pour the cocktail mixture over it.
Let rest about 20 minutes and then filter through a large fine mesh strainer covered with one layer of coffee filter and a nylon nut milk bag.
Let dripping until the liquid runs clear and then, switch vessel.
Wait a couple of minutes before pouring the cloudy liquid over the unfiltered mixture.
Then, let filtering all the way through.

How to Make the Strawberry Daiquiri & Coconut Foam
(Will top about 10 cocktails)

200 ml Unsweetened organic Coconut water
100 ml Lime juice
100 ml Strawberry  syrup
30 ml white rum
2.4 gr Methyl Cellulose
0.7 gr xanthan Gum
6 drops 20% Saline solution

Add all ingredients to a blender and blend at high speed for 30 seconds.
Pour the mixture in a 500 ml cream whipper and charge it with a No2 cartridge.
Shake for about 30 seconds and place in the fridge one hour before using it.

The first commercial release was a version on the late 1986 album Miami Vice II, the second volume of music from the television show.

Miami Vice - en España: Corrupción en Miami; en Hispanoamérica: Miami Vice, Miami: Policía Especial, División Miami o Vicio en Miami: es una serie de televisión estadounidense producida por Michael Mann para la NBC. La serie se caracterizó por su novedosa integración de música y efectos visuales para narrar la historia.

Esta serie es largamente recordada principalmente por las ropas elegantes que los detectives Sonny Crockett y Ricardo Tubbs vestían, el sonido y los distintos efectos visuales. Pero bajo la superficie, es un programa de sorprendentemente oscuros policías. La explosión de la cocaína en la década de los 80s enmarcó muchas historias de drogas y asesinato, con Crockett y Tubbs recurriendo con frecuencia a la violencia para hacer su trabajo.

La Serie Miami Vice esta protagonizada por:

Olivia Brown como Trudy Joplin, o la detective Big Booty
Philip Michael Thomas como Rico Tubbs
Saundra Santiago como Gina Calabrese
Michael Talbott como Stan Switek
Edward James Olmos como El teniente Martin Castillo
John Diehl como El Detective Larry Zito

Game: Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002)
Developed by: Rockstar Games
Published by: Rockstar Games
Recording Software: Nvidia Shadowplay
Platform: PC



âœª ABOUT
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a 2002 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the fourth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2001's Grand Theft Auto III, and the sixth instalment overall. Set in 1986 within the fictional Vice City (based on Miami), the single-player story follows mobster Tommy Vercetti's rise to power after being released from prison and becoming caught up in an ambushed drug deal. While seeking out those responsible, he slowly builds an empire by seizing power from other criminal organisations in the city.

The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets the player freely roam Vice City, consisting of two main islands. The game's plot is based on multiple real-world people and events in Miami such as Cubans, Haitians, and biker gangs, the 1980s crack epidemic, the Mafioso drug lords of Miami, and the dominance of glam metal. The game was also influenced by the film and television of the era, most notably Scarface and Miami Vice. Much of the development work constituted creating the game world to fit the inspiration and time period; the development team conducted extensive field research in Miami while creating the world. The game was released in October 2002 for the PlayStation 2, in May 2003 for Microsoft Windows, and in October 2003 for the Xbox.

Upon release, Vice City received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its music, gameplay and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy over its depiction of violence and racial groups, sparking lawsuits and protests. Vice City became the best-selling video game of 2002 and has sold over 17.5 million copies. Considered one of the most significant titles of the sixth generation of video games and one of the greatest video games ever made, it won numerous year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. Since its release, the game has received numerous ports to many gaming platforms. An enhanced version was released for mobile platforms in 2012 for the game's tenth anniversary, and a further enhanced version is scheduled for release in 2021. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, was released in October 2004, and a prequel, Vice City Stories, was released in October 2006.

The song “You Never Listen to Me” by Peter Cetera was featured in the Miami Vice episode titled ""Redemption in Blood"". This episode is part of the fifth season of the series. The song appears during a scene where Burnett shoots at Tubbs and Tubbs escapes.

""You Never Listen to Me"" is a song by Peter Cetera from his 1988 album ""One More Story"". The song features David Gilmour, the guitarist from Pink Floyd, on guitar. Here are some of the lyrics:

```
You say, ""Not now, it's too late
Now's not the time, it can wait""
You never listen to me
Some things are hard to forget
It's time to do something you might regret
You never listen to me, please listen to me
I think that you must be blind
Haven't you noticed that I'm not around?
Wasting your precious time
You never listen to me, please listen to me

From the famous AMG Hammer to the Koenig Specials 560 SEC, The Patina Collective is home to the world's most unique and influential Mercedes-Benz. We are not car guys though. We are culture guys. We appreciate these cars for their cultural relevance and the eras of Miami Vice and 80s opulence that they symbolize. The rarest tuner Mercedes from SGS Styling Garage, ABC Exclusive, Koenig Specials, RennTech, Brabus, pre-merger AMG, Gemballa, Maybach, and more, all lie within our Mercedes collection in Boca Raton, Florida. Benz culture runs deep in our blood and we aim to share with you all our passion, knowledge, and dedication to keeping these widebody cars alive. This is more than a car collection for us - more than a vintage Mercedes collection - it is a preservation of global cultural history!

Game: Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002)
Developed by: Rockstar Games
Published by: Rockstar Games
Recording Software: Nvidia Shadowplay
Platform: PC



âœª ABOUT
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a 2002 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the fourth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2001's Grand Theft Auto III, and the sixth instalment overall. Set in 1986 within the fictional Vice City (based on Miami), the single-player story follows mobster Tommy Vercetti's rise to power after being released from prison and becoming caught up in an ambushed drug deal. While seeking out those responsible, he slowly builds an empire by seizing power from other criminal organisations in the city.

The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets the player freely roam Vice City, consisting of two main islands. The game's plot is based on multiple real-world people and events in Miami such as Cubans, Haitians, and biker gangs, the 1980s crack epidemic, the Mafioso drug lords of Miami, and the dominance of glam metal. The game was also influenced by the film and television of the era, most notably Scarface and Miami Vice. Much of the development work constituted creating the game world to fit the inspiration and time period; the development team conducted extensive field research in Miami while creating the world. The game was released in October 2002 for the PlayStation 2, in May 2003 for Microsoft Windows, and in October 2003 for the Xbox.

Upon release, Vice City received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its music, gameplay and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy over its depiction of violence and racial groups, sparking lawsuits and protests. Vice City became the best-selling video game of 2002 and has sold over 17.5 million copies. Considered one of the most significant titles of the sixth generation of video games and one of the greatest video games ever made, it won numerous year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. Since its release, the game has received numerous ports to many gaming platforms. An enhanced version was released for mobile platforms in 2012 for the game's tenth anniversary, and a further enhanced version is scheduled for release in 2021. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, was released in October 2004, and a prequel, Vice City Stories, was released in October 2006.

It's not my best AI remix, but thereâ€™s something about it that I'm curious if people will vibe with. Itâ€™s got a more upbeat '70s/'80s feel, a bit different from the original's haunting vibe, but still captures the essence of In the Air Tonight by Phil Collins.

I'm getting quite lost in music with so many projects running. I'll release something on Halloweenâ€”curious to see what people think. Itâ€™s almost a glitch in our AI adventure, but Iâ€™ll share it later.

Fun fact: this track has been used in Risky Business, Miami Vice, and Paid in Fullâ€”pretty much in every possible way you could imagine.

Also, in true South Park spirit, if Phil Collins ends up crying again, I guess Iâ€™ll have to throw him another fake Oscar to cheer him up. 

Let me know what you think. Iâ€™m cooking up a lot right now, mostly for my personal playlist (though Iâ€™ll be putting together some more focused ones soon). Iâ€™ve noticed people are watching, liking, and even disliking theseâ€”it definitely has an impact on it.

I Like Your T-shirt But You Are Not My Friend
(Music & lyrics by Sani Anttila)

[cop arrives at the scene of crime]

He was standing behind a curtain
I showed my badge when he turned 
I thought it was Blood on his shirt, 
but I realized it was the end

I said, ""I like your t-shirt, 
but you are not my friend
The case youâ€™re holding 
belongs to someone else!""

BITCH.

Everything fine was in its splits
The other day was a shooting with the Crips
Work follows me into my home
My wife is nagging on the phone

I said, ""I like your t-shirt
but you are not my friend
The dress you hold 
Belongs to someone else!â€

BITCH.

Florence
City in Italy
Florence, capital of Italyâ€™s Tuscany region, is home to many masterpieces of Renaissance art and architecture. One of its most iconic sights is the Duomo, a cathedral with a terracotta-tiled dome engineered by Brunelleschi and a bell tower by Giotto. The Galleria dell'Accademia displays Michelangeloâ€™s â€œDavidâ€ sculpture.

Guerrero escapes on plane and boat.


Searching the wide oceans with hooks and spears
We shake the tall trees till the leaves drop round our ears
Swimming the cold water where the sun will never shine
Making preparations for the whip-crack time
Hauling the kraken up with blocks and chains -
We're sailing into the eyes of hurricanes
You know that no-one here gets out alive
Only one thing makes it when the devil drives:
We're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -
We're going running on the rocks again...
Flaming amazement - madder than the gale
Wreathed in shadows; crackling in the sails
This is our mission now as then -
We can do no other here we stand: amen
The winds are crying - remember me
Through the holy silence of the desert and the sea
The next armada waiting for the tide
Wind and rain are nothing to the storm inside
we're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -
We're going running on the rocks again...
We're gonna steel up the flesh to the fire
You gonna find out what the rules are then
Well sister, sister, won't you pray for me -

Brilho relÃ³gio da baby vice 
Fode sorrisinho E olha pra trÃ¡s 
Vamos pra baile ou Miami Vice
CÃª tÃ¡ tÃ£o sexy se veste nada 
Brilho relÃ³gio da baby vice 
Fode sorrisinho E olha pra trÃ¡s 
Vamos pra baile ou Miami Vice
CÃª tÃ¡ tÃ£o sexy 
Vejo a maldade no olhar 
Dessa garota 
Adoro o jeito safada 
Me mostra polpa 
Algumas taÃ§as de vinho 
Te deixam solta 
Adora me provocar 
Com dedo na boca 
Bate no rÃ¡dio bae
Hoje te pego Ã s 6 
Que eu sei que vocÃª 
Quer curtir a noite com Thug
HMMM 
Um fake luv 
EstÃ¡ pulando em mim 
como se fosse roda punk 
CÃª nÃ£o Ã© mais como antes 
Se eu tÃ´ com ela 
Sabe eu paro o tempo 
Bolo mais um 
Deixo esse clima lento 
Quero te ver 
No seu melhor momento 
Enquanto vocÃª joga

Vitello

Quando vocÃª joga eu fico em transe
Tragos do skunk 
Te levam pra outro mundo amor 
Sei que me acha meio ignorante 
Mas sinceramente 
CÃª alugou minha mente 
Com essa bunda muito potente 
Bandidos como Bonnie e Clyde 
Ela rouba a cena 
Quando carbura do meu ice 
Se eu tÃ´ livre 
Ela nÃ£o me deixa em paz 
Se molha escutando minha voz 
Me instiga com a cor da sua calcinha 
(Oh my god) 
Ela quer um amor falso
Quer viver de uma vida fÃ¡cil 
E eu li todo o seu prefÃ¡cio 
Adoro quando vem no bounce 
Camisa da Pace 
Ela nunca cansa 
EntÃ£o senta de uma vez 
NÃ£o sei quÃª que tem nessa garota mas me viciou
Ã‰ pior que drug

W_XiIR1a-ak,24,,World Style,0.0,hd,"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a 2002 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the fourth main game in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2001's Grand Theft Auto III, and the sixth entry overall. Set in 1986 within the fictional Vice City (based on Miami and Miami Beach), the single-player story follows mobster Tommy Vercetti's rise to power after being released from prison and becoming caught up in an ambushed drug deal. While seeking out those responsible, Tommy gradually builds a criminal empire by seizing power from other criminal organisations in the city.

The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets the player freely roam Vice City, consisting of two main islands. The game's plot is based on multiple real-world people and events in Miami such as Cubans, Haitians, and biker gangs, the 1980s crack epidemic, the Mafioso drug lords of Miami, and the dominance of glam metal. The game was also influenced by the films and television of the era, most notably Scarface and Miami Vice. Much of the development work constituted creating the game world to fit the inspiration and time period; the development team conducted extensive field research in Miami while creating the world. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was released in October 2002 for the PlayStation 2, in May 2003 for Windows, and in November 2003 for the Xbox.

Upon its release, Vice City received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its music, gameplay, story, and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy over its depiction of violence and racial groups, sparking lawsuits and protests. Vice City became the best-selling video game of 2002 and has sold over 17.5 million copies. Considered one of the most significant titles of the sixth generation of video games and one of the greatest video games ever made, it won numerous year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications.

Since its release, the game has received numerous ports to many gaming platforms. An enhanced version was released for mobile platforms in 2012 for the game's tenth anniversary, and a further enhanced version was released in 2021. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, was released in October 2004, and a prequel, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, was released in October 2006.",PT6M19S,1.0,public,2024-10-28T13:46:59Z,"Grand Theft Auto V,GTA V,GTA 5,Grand Theft Auto 5,Grand Theft Auto,1 st,1st mission,Sinhala,sinhala Game Play,Sinhala Game Replay,Rockstar,GTA V 1st Mission,Gta 6,GTA VI,Sri Lanka,Grand Theft Auto Online,Episode 1,Liberty City,First-person shooters,Video games set in 2013,Game of the Year,GTA,GTA VC,GTA SA,Grand Theft Auto VI,VC,SA,World Style,World,Style,Grand Theft Auto - Vice City,Vice City,In tha Beginning,Tommy Vercetti's,Tommy,Tom",In tha beginning...

iwqY2sRXq_Y,24,UCh7mxML-d1EM-PLJlXtcaiQ, Dias Drake,47.0,hd,"Miami Vice é uma série de televisão norte-americana de drama policial, estrelada por Don Johnson como James ""Sonny"" Crockett e Philip Michael Thomas como Ricardo ""Rico"" Tubbs, dois detetives tão competentes quanto agressivos do Departamento de Polícia de Metro-Dade ou MDPD trabalhando disfarçados em Miami. Tráfico de drogas, extorsão, prostituição e muitos outros crimes estão nas mãos deles para resolver. Com contas a acertar com traficantes e bandidos, eles percebem que fazer isso pode significar ir contra a própria justiça. A série durou 5 temporadas na NBC, de 16 de setembro de 1984 a 28 de junho de 1989 com 114 episódios. 
Ao contrário dos procedimentos policiais padrão, o seriado se baseou fortemente na cultura New Wave dos anos 1980 e é conhecido por sua integração de música pop e rock contemporânea e visuais elegantes e estilizados. Em 2006 foi lançada uma adaptação cinematográfica modernizada baseada na série. #miamivice #nostalgia #seriesantigas

C’è da crederci. In onda per la prima volta sul network NBC il 16 settembre 1984 (il venerdì sera in prima serata, in concorrenza diretta con Falcon Crest), l’avvento di “Miami Vice” cambia per sempre il modo di fare televisione. Solo un anno dopo, infatti, i due poliziotti sono già sulla copertina di TIME e il titolo – “Cool Cops, Hot Show” – sancisce il successo della serie. Fondamentali alcuni ingredienti: la centralità del tema musicale (affidato ad artisti di grande successo, da Phil Collins ai Dire Straits, e per la prima volta trasmesso in TV in stereo), l’uso quasi esclusivo dei colori pastello (nessun colore di terra), un nuovo stile nel vestire (Macy’s ospita nei propri negozi corner di abbigliamento ispirati al telefilm) e in più tutto il sex appeal di un Don Johnson al massimo della sua fama. Saranno in tutto 111 episodi, che da quel settembre 1984 saranno trasmessi fino al 1989, ma l’eredità di Miami Vice rimane ancora oggi fortissima.

There are those that say that the '80s only really became the '80s when the soundtrack of “In The Air Tonight” by Phil Collins began to accompany Crockett (Don Johnson) and his partner Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) on their night-time adventures on the streets of Miami. It's not such a far-fetched idea. Broadcast for the first time on the NBC network on the 16th of September 1984 (primetime on Friday evening, in direct competition with Falcon Crest), the advent of Miami Vice changed television forever. Just one year later the two police officers were already on the cover of TIME, under the title “Cool Cops, Hot Show”, sanctioning the series' success. Fundamental ingredients of the show: the central role played by the theme music (played by highly successful musicians, from Phil Collins to Dire Straits, and broadcast in stereo for television for the first time), the almost exclusive use of pastel colours (no earth tones), a new way of dressing (Macy’s dedicated special corners in its stores to clothing inspired by the series) and above all the sex appeal of Don Johnson at the height of his fame. The series may have stopped at 111 episodes, running from that September in 1984 until 1989, but the legacy of Miami Vice is still strong even today.",PT5M45S,795.0,public,2015-06-23T08:48:52Z,"Miami Vice (TV Program),Miami (City/Town/Village),federico bu,Don Johnson (Film Actor)",Federico Buffa Racconta Miami Vice,93557.0,True,2025-12-09,2025-12-09

Re-Extended because it has already been officially extended for the 12'' vinyl. However the official extended version was ""only"" 5'50''. So, I did more... It's been remastered from the original vinyl in ultra high quality (24bits/192khz). The original rip was riddled with cracks and hiss and it took me a while to clean it up. It's not a loop!

The series stars Don Johnson as James ""Sonny"" Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Ricardo ""Rico"" Tubbs, two Metro-Dade Police Department detectives working undercover in Miami. The series ran for five seasons on NBC from 1984 to 1989. The USA Network began airing reruns in 1988 and broadcast a previously unaired episode during its syndication run of the series on January 25, 1990.

Unlike standard police procedurals, the show drew heavily upon 1980s New Wave culture and is noted for its integration of contemporary pop and rock music and stylish or stylized visuals. People magazine states that Miami Vice was the ""first show to look really new and different since color TV was invented"".

Michael Mann directed a film adaptation of the series, which was released July 28, 2006.

""...There's a river pouring
From a pure and a crystal stream
And it carries my heart along
Carries me all my life
And I know it will bring me home

There's a choir singing
With a force that can light the sky
I will join with a voice deep inside
Anthems for joys gone by
And for joys I am sure will come

Golden treasure in the evening sky
It's good to be alive
Golden measure, hear the music cry
When my heart sings
Of golden things


There's a dove ascending
Like my thoughts in the summer sky
And she carries my soul along
Clear to eternity
And I know I am not alone

Golden treasure in the evening sky
It's good to be alive
Golden measure, hear the music cry
When my heart sings
Of golden things

There's a river pouring
From a pure and a crystal stream
And it carries my heart along
Carries me all my life
And I know it will bring me home...""

Everybody heard about the TV series Miami Vice at least once, but maybe not everybody remember the main theme (including me unfortunately). This is probably the most 80's stuff I have ever listened and so is the visuals of the sleeve, with it's blue and pink lettering. Enjoy !

I suspect that the guys who made Death Rally were inspired by this song for the game's intro song.

Directed by Olmos himself in his directorial debut. 
By far my favorite episode.

Though perhaps best known for the action sequence, I also liked his friendship with Jack Gretsky/Dean Stockwell. The both of them would later star together again in the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series. 

Compiled this many years ago, a few PC's back, on windows movie maker & Fraps. Re-editing the extracted file several times resulted in a severe loss in quality, especially noticeable in the beginning. I've thought about doing it again with better capture software & shotcut, though it still remains one of my favorite edits.

Miami Vice – die erfolgreichste Krimiserie der 80er – stand 1986 kurz vor dem Aus. Und das nicht wegen schlechter Quoten, sondern wegen Don Johnson selbst. Der Star verschwand plötzlich vom Set, fünf Drehtage fielen aus, und Universal verklagte ihn auf 20 Millionen Dollar. NBC hatte sogar schon Ersatzpläne für Sonny Crockett in der Schublade. Doch das war nur die Spitze des Eisbergs. Bleib unbedingt dran, denn die Wahrheit hinter Miami Vice ist düsterer, als du denkst.

Miami Vice was a show that exploded into pop culture, changing the way TV was made and the fashion of the 1980's, overseen by one of the most influential filmmakers of our time.

But Miami Vice also had its share of detractors for glamourizing drugs and violence.

[ Miami Vice, 1984 - Comment by W. M. Aslam (England) ]

Miami Vice was a hugely successful and influential TV show that would go on to be mimicked by other TV shows as well as films. Crocket and Tubbs were the coolest duo of the 80s. The look, sound, dialogue and subject matter summed up the 1980s perfectly. 
Don Johnson was cooler than ice, and Philip Michael Thomas was hotter than the Miami sun. The two men played Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs, drug-enforcement officers in a bright and fashionable Miami. At the time Miami was a run-down town, plagued with drugs as well as other social and economic problems. It’s no secret that Miami Vice helped the area prosper to eventually become what it is today. 
The show was a watershed moment in TV much like how MTV changed music and music videos. Crocket and  Tubbs took on hardened criminals and suffered for it. They showed the real side of policing, where the risk of  being harmed or even killed was an occupational hazard. What really made the show for me, was their  friendship. 
I can’t write about Miami Vice and not talk more about their pastel-shaded fashion, the stubble-faces, sock- free and carefree hairstyles. The look of Miami Vice is what made it stand out from other police shows. The  pastel colours added warmth to their personalities and complemented the Miami sunshine. The colours  popped out as did everything else in the show. The rough, unclean, dishevelled look was to Miami Vice what  Clint Eastwood was to Fistful of Dollars. 
The grooming style reminded me of that 1960s Spaghetti Western look made popular by legendary as well as visionary film director Sergio Leone. I imagine Michael Man was influenced by Leone’s anti-hero characters. The Sonny Crocket look became very popular with guys. The light-coloured blazer, pastel T-shirt and shoes without socks became commonplace. I can still remember some of my older friends wearing this look.",PT7M48S,8178.0,public,2024-06-01T05:36:52Z,"sky division,jan hammer,moreno j,miami vice,crockett's theme,tribute,remix","""Tribute to Jan Hammer (Miami Vice, 1984)"" - Sky Division, 2024",1075544.0,True,2025-12-09,2025-12-09

Miami Vice is an American television crime drama series produced by Michael Mann for NBC. The series starred Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas as James ""Sonny"" Crockett and Ricardo ""Rico"" Tubbs respectively, two Metro-Dade Police Department detectives working undercover in Miami. 

The series ran for five seasons on NBC from 1984--1989. The USA Network later began airing reruns the next year, in 1990, and actually broadcast an originally unaired episode during its syndication run of the series on January 25, 1990.",PT1M56S,3004.0,public,2016-02-29T18:49:17Z,"Miami Vice,tv theme,television series,intro,crime,detective,undercover,drugs,Florida,tv tune,episode,classic",Miami Vice 1984 - 1989 Opening and Closing Theme HD Dolby 5.1,473665.0,True,2025-12-09,2025-12-09
