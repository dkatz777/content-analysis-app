The Amazing Race Theme - All Three Versions,FGQsJC7Y4J8,Allen Douangchak,2016-10-08T13:17:54Z,"All three versions of The Amazing Race theme song!

The Amazing Race is an American reality competition show in which typically eleven teams of two race around the world. The race is generally split into twelve legs, with each leg requiring teams to deduce clues, navigate themselves in foreign areas, interact with locals, perform physical and mental challenges, and vie for airplane, boat, taxi, and other public transportation options on a limited budget provided by the show. Teams are progressively eliminated at the end of most legs, while the first team to arrive at the end of the final leg wins the grand prize of US$1 million. As the original version of the Amazing Race franchise, the CBS program has been running since 2001. The series concluded airing its 28th season on May 13, 2016 and has been renewed for at least one more season in 2016â€“17. The 29th season is scheduled to premiere mid-season during the 2016â€“17 television season. Numerous international versions have been developed following the same core structure, while the U.S. version is also broadcast to several other markets.

The show was created by Elise Doganieri and Bertram van Munster, who, along with Jonathan Littman, serve as executive producers. The show is produced by Earthview Inc. (headed by Doganieri and van Munster), Bruckheimer Television for CBS Television Studios and ABC Studios (a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company). The series has been hosted by veteran New Zealand television personality Phil Keoghan since its inception.

Since the inception of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program in 2003, The Amazing Race has won it ten out of twelve times; the show has also won other awards and commendations. Although it has moved around several prime time slots since its inception, the program has averaged about 10 million viewers per season.

KVPDKVDKVDKPDBKPDBBPID Iâ€™m so happy, probably my favorite reality tv winners ever. My favorite tar team actually won, and itâ€™s kinda surreal to see because Iâ€™ve loved them since I watched them on season five. Their redemption ark from that season was incredible. Colin, in season five, was the last person youâ€™d ever expect to be talking about meditating and stuff on another season. Loved them, this cast and season, cant wait for tar 32.

30 Rock Synopsis: EmmyÂ®-winner Tina Fey writes, executive produces and stars as writer Liz Lemon in 30 Rock, an irreverent, wildly funny, EmmyÂ®-winning workplace comedy set behind-the-scenes of a live variety show. The series is told through the comedic voice of Fey and features the inimitable and EmmyÂ®-winning Alec Baldwin as Jack Donaghy, the brash network executive who turns Liz's show (and life) upside down with his meddling ways. Set in New York City, 30 Rock also stars Tracy Morgan, Jane Krakowski, Scott Adsit, and Jack McBrayer, and boasts a cavalcade of guest appearances from some of the most respected and recognizable faces in comedy.

They mistakenly thought that was the challenge. Once they completed a sample of the craft piece, they were looking for surongs since it was apart of the challenge. The funny thing is, the residents probably gave them their own surongs from inside the house.

The Amazing Race | Phil Keoghan | Talks at Google,qShFHIzAnoE,Talks at Google,2017-05-04T16:41:13Z,"Talks at Google hosted Phil Keoghan, host and a producer of CBSâ€™s ten-time Emmy Award-winning reality series, THE AMAZING RACE, for a talk on April 17th, 2017. 

Join in as Phil takes us inside The Amazing Race with behind-the-scenes stories and highlights. The beloved reality show kicks off the 29th season this year as 11 teams of strangers pair up to run the race of a lifetime and compete for the $1 million prize.

The talk also covers Philâ€™s new documentary, LE RIDE.  Le Ride shares the story of four young men from Australia and New Zealand who competed in the 1928 Tour de France, considered by many as the toughest sporting event in the world. Phil and his wingman Ben Cornell took on the biggest physical and mental challenge of their lives, attempting to recreate the route on vintage steel bikes, with no gears.

The talk was hosted by Cindy Halvorsen (a Googler and Winner of Season 19 of The Amazing Race).

At every destination, each team must compete in a series of challenges, some mental and some physical, and only when the tasks are completed will they learn of their next location. Teams who are the farthest behind will gradually be eliminated as the contest progresses, with the first team to arrive at the final destination winning $1 million.","The Amazing Race,Amazing Race,Amazing Race 1,Amazing Race Watermelon,watermelon,Amazing Race 2,Amazing Race 3,Amazing Race 4,Amazing Race 5,Amazing Race Asia,Phil Kehogan,reality tv,Amazing Race Online,couples,challenges,world travel,contest,Watch Amazing Race,eliminated,the mat,Amazing Race CBS,CBS Amazing Race,CBS",24,23567,203,37,PT3M2S,hd,public

The Amazing Race - Ghana (#1),_xzlrMzG0vM,Ghanapedia,2011-05-21T08:00:39Z,"This clip is part (1) of (7) of the popular western television show called ""The Amazing Race"". The show features competing pairs of contestants racing through countries, using orienteering skills to make their way through challenges arranged in each country.

Ghana featured in 2.5 episodes of the series. My main criticism of this show was that they limited themselves to the Greater Accra Region, and showed areas that were not so flattering to Ghana, so it was somewhat misrepresented.

I would have thought that the government would have allowed them to film and obtain visas, but would regulate the areas they wanted to show in order to promote Ghana. Instead, the positive points seemed to be a flash of the Golden Jubilee House, and some filming around the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial. While I can see why Teshie/Nungua was selected (the ceremonial Ga coffins), I feel that they should have taken the challenge across country, perhaps to the Central or Volta regions (or even the Northern Region), and shown areas of historical or ecological interest (St George Castle in Elmina, Kakum National Park, or Larabanga & Mole N/P spring to mind).

Instead, we got two of Accra's biggest markets - Kaneshie & Makola - which are more orientated for local trade, rather than international trade (the National Cultural Centre probably would have been better, as it shows local crafts & products). A reasonably regular traveller to Ghana like me generally doesn't go to either of these markets much, unless there is something particular that I am after.

Then the producers took the show to Nsawam. While this is a typical Ghanaian town, and trying not to upset any locals to that town, but I think that there were better options within an hour or two's travel from central Accra (Aburi & Mampong are close and each have significant points of interest, and Winneba, Senya Beraku, & Apam are all easily reached west of Accra, and Atimpoku/Akosombo is easily reached to the east, and features some of the most recognizable landmarks of Ghana - the Akosombo Dam & the Adome Bridge).

The fighting school thing was another thing I didn't get.......I had never heard of it, and yet the Mantse Palace, the WATO Club, or the Accra Lighthouse were all right in this area and of greater importance as landmarks.


Anyway, this is what we got, and the government probably should have advised a little better, so we just have to enjoy what I consider a bit of an unflattering view of Ghana.","The,Amazing,Race,Ghana,#1",24,20203,45,12,PT14M56S,sd,public

AMAZING RACE : Rendez-vous Ã  Bangkok pour manger des SCORPIONS ! | DubaÃ¯ Ã  Bangkok |  EPISODE 2,O-C3G3koW8s,ICON TV - Aventure,2024-03-24T18:00:14Z,"L'aventure Amazing Race continue pour les 8 binÃ´mes encore en course. Les concurrents changent de continent et quittent la chaleur de DubaÃ¯ pour le charme de l'Asie et plus particuliÃ¨rement la typique Bangkok en ThaÃ¯lande. 

Pour plus de jeux d'aventure, abonnez-vous pour ne rien rater ðŸ‘‰http://bit.ly/3Rnzz6N ðŸŒŽðŸ¥¾

Dans les mÃ©andres de cette mÃ©galopole aux 14 millions d'habitants, les concurrents devront tout faire pour ne pas se faire distancer et Ã©viter l'Ã©limination. Pour cela, ils devront relever les dÃ©fis les plus osÃ©s, comme pour le fameux crossroad, Ã©preuve incontournable du jeu durant lequel, ils devront manger un plat local Ã  base de scorpions et de blattes ou encore faire leurs courses avec une liste Ã©crite en thaÃ¯landais. Ils devront aussi supporter la chaleur et l'effort physique lors du roadblock, une autre Ã©preuve incontournable de l'Ã©mission sur laquelle les concurrents auront Ã  compter les statues qui se trouvent en haut d'un monument de 120 marches ! Mais les binÃ´mes vivront Ã©galement des moments de tendresse avec la dÃ©couverte d'une association de sauvegarde des Ã©lÃ©phants thaÃ¯landais...une parenthÃ¨se enchantÃ©e dans la course. Au terme de 2 jours de course incroyable, les 8 binÃ´mes passeront la ligne d'arrivÃ©e. 7 repartiront vers la prochaine Ã©limination, et le dernier rentrera Ã  Paris sur le champ. Alors qui des surfeuses, des jumeaux, des parisiennes, des copains d'enfance, des bikers, du pÃ¨re et du fils, des flics, des cyber-amis se fera Ã©liminer lors de cette 2e Ã©tape d'Amazing Race ?

THE AMAZING RACE is a multi-Emmy Award-winning reality series hosted by Emmy Award- nominated host Phil Keoghan, which pits 11 teams, each comprised of two members, against each other on a trek around the world for approximately 25 days. At every destination, each team must compete in a series of challenges, some mental and some physical, and only when the tasks are completed will they learn of their next location. Teams who are the farthest behind will gradually be eliminated as the contest progresses, with the first team to arrive at the final destination winning $1 million.","The Amazing Race,Amazing Race,Amazing Race 1,Amazing Race Watermelon,watermelon,Amazing Race 2,Amazing Race 3,Amazing Race 4,Amazing Race 5,Amazing Race Asia,Phil Kehogan,reality tv,Amazing Race Online,couples,challenges,world travel,contest,Watch Amazing Race,eliminated,the mat,Amazing Race CBS,CBS Amazing Race,CBS",24,9373,65,6,PT1M52S,hd,public

THE AMAZING RACE is a multi-Emmy Award-winning reality series hosted by Emmy Award- nominated host Phil Keoghan, which pits 11 teams, each comprised of two members, against each other on a trek around the world for approximately 25 days. At every destination, each team must compete in a series of challenges, some mental and some physical, and only when the tasks are completed will they learn of their next location. Teams who are the farthest behind will gradually be eliminated as the contest progresses, with the first team to arrive at the final destination winning $1 million.","The Amazing Race,Amazing Race,Amazing Race 1,Amazing Race Watermelon,watermelon,Amazing Race 2,Amazing Race 3,Amazing Race 4,Amazing Race 5,Amazing Race Asia,Phil Kehogan,reality tv,Amazing Race Online,couples,challenges,world travel,contest,Watch Amazing Race,eliminated,the mat,Amazing Race CBS,CBS Amazing Race,CBS",24,3972,36,2,PT3M4S,hd,public

THE AMAZING RACE is a multi-Emmy Award-winning reality series hosted by Emmy Award- nominated host Phil Keoghan, which pits teams of two members against each other on a trek around the world for approximately 25 days. At every destination, each team must compete in a series of challenges, some mental and some physical, and only when the tasks are completed will they learn of their next location. Teams who are the farthest behind will gradually be eliminated as the contest progresses, with the first team to arrive at the final destination winning $1 million.","The Amazing Race,Amazing Race,Amazing Race 1,Amazing Race Watermelon,watermelon,Amazing Race 2,Amazing Race 3,Amazing Race 4,Amazing Race 5,Amazing Race Asia,Phil Kehogan,reality tv,Amazing Race Online,couples,challenges,world travel,contest,Watch Amazing Race,eliminated,the mat,Amazing Race CBS,CBS Amazing Race,CBS",24,1745,38,4,PT2M8S,hd,public
