The Mysterious Disappearance of D B Cooper | FBI Files,zMghfzfDKdk,2amBLT,2024-10-28T18:00:41Z,"Dan Cooper, later known as ""D.B. Cooper,"" boarded Northwest Orient Airlines Flight #305 on November 24, 1971, carrying nothing more than a briefcase and a sense of mystery. Soon after the plane took off from Portland, Oregon, the man handed a note to a flight attendant, calmly stating that he had a bomb in his briefcase. Cooper demanded $200,000 in cash, four parachutes, and a fuel truck ready to refuel the plane in Seattle.

Upon landing in Seattle, Cooper received the ransom and released the passengers, keeping only a few crew members. He then instructed the pilots to fly toward Mexico City at a low altitude and slow speed, with the plane's rear exit open. Somewhere over the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest, Cooper parachuted into the dark, rainy night, disappearing without a trace. Despite an extensive investigation, his identity and fate remain one of America's most intriguing unsolved mysteries.

The Black Dahlia | FBI Files #2amblt,Sqo7pFNsdbE,2amBLT,2024-10-22T01:36:16Z,"The Black Dahlia case remains one of the most notorious unsolved murders in American history. In January 1947, the body of 22-year-old Elizabeth Short was discovered in Leimert Park, Los Angeles, horrifically mutilated. Her body had been severed at the waist, drained of blood, and her face had been slashed from mouth to ear in a chilling â€œGlasgow smile.â€ Short, an aspiring actress, had come to Hollywood in search of fame, but her life ended in a tragedy that captivated the media and the public. She was dubbed the ""Black Dahlia"" due to her rumored affinity for dark clothing and the popular film noir The Blue Dahlia.
The case drew intense media attention, leading to numerous false leads, confessions, and speculation. Despite investigating hundreds of suspects, the LAPD was unable to find the killer, and the case remains unsolved to this day. The mystery surrounding her death has spawned countless conspiracy theories, books, and films, with some speculating ties to corrupt officials, underground Hollywood scandals, and even connections to the infamous Cleveland Torso Murders. The Black Dahlia case continues to fascinate true crime enthusiasts and remains a symbol of Hollywood's darker, hidden underworld.

The Chilling Kidnapping of Charles Ross | FBI Files #2amblt,PsJNzVeiezs,2amBLT,2024-10-26T03:00:20Z,"In late September 1937, Charles S. Ross, the president of a successful greeting card company, was en route to Chicago when his life took a terrifying turn. While driving, Ross was pulled over and abducted at gunpoint by two men who had meticulously planned the kidnapping, aiming to secure a substantial ransom. Known for his wealth, Ross became an appealing target for criminals looking to make quick money, and his captors soon contacted his family, demanding a ransom for his safe return.

The FBI and local authorities launched an extensive investigation, combing through leads and mobilizing resources to locate Ross and apprehend the kidnappers. Despite the fear and urgency surrounding the case, Ross's ordeal ended safely; he was released without harm after negotiations. The kidnappers, however, were soon captured and brought to justice, facing the full consequences of their actions. The high-profile kidnapping of Charles Ross underscored the eraâ€™s growing concerns over organized crime and ransom abductions, leading to heightened security measures and further FBI involvement in protecting high-profile individuals.

They built a raft, slipped through the dark, and vanished into the night. But hereâ€™s the big question: Did they survive? ðŸŒŠðŸš¨ Even now, no one knows for sure.

Frank Sinatra Jr Kidnapping | FBI Files #2amblt,1-JThJ_w-9I,2amBLT,2024-10-27T03:00:00Z,"On December 8, 1963, Frank Sinatra, Jr., son of the legendary singer Frank Sinatra, became the victim of a high-profile kidnapping orchestrated by three inexperienced criminals aiming for a big payout. Sinatra, Jr., then 19 years old and building a music career of his own, was performing at Harrahâ€™s Lodge in Lake Tahoe when he was abducted from his hotel room by Barry Keenan, Johnny Irwin, and Joe Amsler. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of $240,000, a substantial sum at the time, which they believed would be their ticket to wealth.

After three tense days and with the FBI closely involved, Sinatraâ€™s father paid the ransom. The young Sinatra was released unharmed along a California freeway. The kidnappers, however, did not remain free for long; within days, they were apprehended, and the ransom money was largely recovered. The case captured national attention, both for its fearless nature and for the involvement of such a prominent family. Over time, Frank Sinatra, Jr.â€™s kidnapping became an infamous example of the lengths people would go to for financial gain, as well as a significant chapter in American criminal history.

The Great Brinkâ€™s Robbery | FBI Files #2amblt,dz5sGS1jvRQ,2amBLT,2024-10-23T09:00:41Z,"The Brinkâ€™s Robbery, one of the most famous heists in U.S. history, took place on January 17, 1950, in Boston, Massachusetts. A group of 11 men meticulously planned and executed the robbery at the Brinkâ€™s Armored Car Depot, making off with nearly $2.7 million in cash, checks, and money ordersâ€”equivalent to over $30 million today. The robbers, wearing Halloween masks and gloves to disguise their identities, broke into the depot with precision, taking only 30 minutes to carry out the heist. Despite the large sum stolen, the thieves left no clues behind, leading to the robbery being called ""the crime of the century.""

The robbers had spent months planning the operation, even rehearsing it multiple times. Their careful execution and lack of evidence initially baffled authorities, and the case went unsolved for years. The FBI and police were unable to make any significant breakthroughs until just days before the statute of limitations expired in 1956. In a dramatic turn, one of the gang members, Joseph ""Specs"" O'Keefe, turned informant after a falling out with the group. His testimony led to the arrest and conviction of the rest of the gang, though only a small portion of the stolen money was ever recovered.

The Brinkâ€™s Robbery remains iconic not only for its scale but also for the near-flawless planning that went into it. The event has inspired numerous books, films, and media over the years, cementing its place as one of the greatest heists in history. Despite the robbersâ€™ eventual capture, the bulk of the money was never found, adding a layer of mystery that continues to captivate true crime enthusiasts.

The First FBI Agent to Fall | FBI Files #2amblt,6RsUAnl0ADQ,2amBLT,2024-10-30T21:00:08Z,"On October 11, 1925, Edwin C. Shanahan, a 27-year-old Special Agent with the FBI, became the first agent to lose his life in the line of duty. Shanahan was assigned to surveil a known gang member, Martin Durkin, in Chicago. Durkin, an infamous car thief with a violent history, was under investigation for his criminal activities. During Shanahan's attempt to apprehend Durkin, a confrontation erupted, leading to a tragic exchange of gunfire in which Shanahan was fatally shot.

Shanahanâ€™s death underscored the dangers faced by federal agents and marked a turning point for the Bureau, highlighting the need for more rigorous training and enhanced safety measures. The Bureau honored Shanahanâ€™s sacrifice by intensifying efforts to bring Durkin to justice, eventually capturing him months later. Today, Shanahan is remembered as a courageous agent whose dedication paved the way for the professionalism and commitment that define the FBI. His legacy remains a solemn reminder of the risks law enforcement officers take to protect the public.

Season 2, Episode 18 - The FBI Files - "".22 Caliber Killer"" - Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.  Using the profile, agents determined a seemingly unrelated event in Georgia was also the work of the .22 caliber killer.  The profile matched the suspect on every point.  It was enough to put the killer away for life.

Tonight, Iâ€™m peeling back the layers of secrecy surrounding UFO crash recoveries, non-human intelligence, and the origins of the U.S. government's involvement in reverse-engineering alien craft. What started as a deep dive into the claims of military insiders has led me to a declassified FBI documentâ€”one that may hold the key to understanding the Roswell crash of 1947 and how it ties directly to the modern UFO retrieval program.

Skywatcher Part I: The Journey Begins
https://youtu.be/PcuxnqQLuAQ?si=KjxbLyBbx3C1bwLW
Skywatcher Part I begins by interviewing individuals directly involved with supposed UAP crash recovery efforts, and individuals who claim to be able to summon these objects in the sky. Interviews and references include Alex Klokus, Jacob Barber, Dr. Garry Nolan, Dave Grusch, Col. Karl Nell, and Fred Baker.

Flagrant DÃ©lit : En juillet 1996, deux hommes font irruption chez un prÃªteur sur gage de Birmingham en Alabama et abattent brutalement les employÃ©s. Mais les meurtriers ignorent quâ€™une camÃ©ra de surveillance cachÃ©e a enregistrÃ© le crime. La police et le FBI diffusent des images de lâ€™homicide dans les mÃ©dias et identifient rapidement ses auteurs. Maintenant, il leur faut retrouver deux meurtrier cruels qui se savent recherchÃ©s.

Poursuite: Ã€ Lincoln County au Nebraska, un trafiquant de drogues en cavale a une confrontation armÃ©e avec des patrouilleurs de lâ€™Ã‰tat. Il en blesse deux et Ã©chappe Ã  ses poursuivants lors dâ€™une poursuite Ã  tombeaux ouverts. Les autoritÃ©s entreprennent alors une chasse Ã  lâ€™Homme Ã  la grandeur de lâ€™Ã‰tat.

Une importante enquÃªte permet aux agents du FBI de retrouver leurs corps. Ils ont Ã©tÃ© tuÃ©s de projectiles. Tous les indices sont recueillis et analysÃ©s. Les experts du laboratoire judiciaire tirent bientÃ´t la conclusion que les projectiles qui ont servi Ã  abattre les trois hommes proviennent de la mÃªme arme Ã  feu. Des agents gagnent la confiance dâ€™un informateur qui les met sur la piste de 7 membres du Klu Klux Klan. Les suspects sont bientÃ´t condamnÃ©s pour leurs crimes.

Mafia Dixie (S02E07): Au Mississippi, sur la cÃ´te du golfe du Mexique, un juge et sa femme sont trouvÃ©s brutalement assassinÃ©s dans leur rÃ©sidence. Le meurtrier nâ€™a laissÃ© que peu dâ€™indices.

But you might be shocked by just how many celebrities have FBI files. Before the White House Ronald Reagan having an FBI file shouldn't be a surprise. After all, they probably liked to know about the President, but he was on the agency's radar long before 1980. In 1947, when he was the president of the Screen Actors Guild, he had a file. But why would they want to know about the staunch conservative? Surely the last suspect anyone would have as a communist agent. Because Reagan was such a strong anti-communist that he and his then-wife Jane Wyman worked with federal agents to turn over the name of any actors they thought might be communists. The future president was an informant, but one more beloved figure had FBI ties as well.",,22,2418,273,1,PT40S,hd,public

The FBI Files reveals the crime busting techniques and forensic science used by the FBI to solve the most baffling cases. James Kallstrom, former head of the FBI's New York Office, hosts these true stories of crime and detection, taking you behind the scenes with re-enactments and interviews with actual participants. Join FBI agents as they work to bring the most notorious criminals to justice.

00:00:00 Death Pact
The average bank robbery yields roughly 3,000 dollars. Yet some criminals risk everything for the take. In suburban Chicago, a disguised gunman began a series of robberies, growing more violent with each one. The trail lead the FBI to suspect involvement from an unlikely source.

00:49:01 Without Mercy
In Richmond, Virginia, two masked men who were robbing a bank escaped after opening fire on officers responding to the call. When the FBI arrived, agents found one bank teller dead, another wounded; the bank's security guard had been shot four times, yet was still alive.

01:38:02 Deadly Takeover
In 2000, the FBI was overwhelmed with investigations in Seattle, which had the third-highest number of bank robberies in the nation. Agents focused on a series of robberies in which two heavily armed men seemed to know where the banks stored their money.

02:27:04 Robin the Hood
In the southwest one serial bank robber claimed his loot went to the poor, but this thief was no folk hero. He had a gun and was willing to shoot. The gunman was desperate to stay free, a threat to anyone in his way. The FBI and U.S. marshals teamed up to capture a resourceful criminal who proved he would never stop fighting.

The gunmen force the janitors to let them in the ATM repository and hold them hostage until the armored car guards arrive to make their nightly collection.  When the guards enter the bank, the gunmen surprise them and shoot one guard in the chest before escaping with $1,088,000, the largest bank robbery take in Las Vegas history.  

FBI agents and police find the getaway truck in a nearby neighborhood and set up surveillance in the area. Investigators search the residence of a woman who has reportedly been spending large sums of money.  The FBI finds a cache of the stolen money and questions the womanâ€™s boyfriend.  He tells them that he believes his brother robbed the ATM repository with another man.  Authorities arrest his accomplice, and this suspect then flees and leads authorities on a chase, but they apprehend him quickly.  Before he can be convicted of the robbery, he commits suicide.

And read Psychologist Michael Nuccitelli's article on iPredator Matthew Berdyck https://ipredator.co/matthew-berdyck-predatory-troll

I made a documentary about a series of events where an Internet Troll claiming to be an activist, filmmaker, journalist and Wagyu Steak Salesman trolled a city in Missouri. Since then, the film and myself have become his main targets for harassment. The documentary is called SOCIAL MEDIA MONSTER and this is another chapter in the online saga that is Matthew Berdyck. 

WARNING! Engaging with Matthew Berdyck will likely result in harassment from him. Do not harass or troll him, itâ€™s not nice and it doesnâ€™t help anyone. Just report and ignore his social media posts that make threats or target any individuals inappropriately.

Investigators quickly discovered that the victim was a dissident member of a religious sect headed by a man calling himself Yahweh ben Yahweh, or God, Son of God.  Although the FBI believed Yahweh ben Yahweh and his followers were responsible for many murders, they could find no direct evidence linking them to the crimes.  Agents knew they had but one recourse: to convince one of the cult leaderâ€™s fanatical followers to betray a man he considered a god.

Silent Strike: In November of 1994, when a Wells Fargo armored van disappeared from a Glendale, Arizona mall, local authorities and the FBI scrambled to recover it, and its cargo of nearly a million dollars.  Six hours later, agents found the van, its driver shot dead inside and the money gone.  It was a perfect hit by professionals who left no clue behind.  Months passed before a solid lead developed.  In January, a tip led agents to look into a former prison guard.  Surveillance uncovered two other suspects, a bounty hunter and a former Phoenix policeman.  The FBI would have its hands full trying to track and build a case against killers whose law enforcement training had made them clever criminals.

Agents processed more than 2000 leads and crossed an ocean in the effort to deliver justice.

Without Mercy (S06E01): At 9:30 am on the morning of January 30, 1997, Richmond, VA police respond to a report of shots fired at a local bank.  Two masked men brandishing automatic weapons confront, and open fire on officers responding to the call.  The gunmen exit the bank, and retreat on foot, eventually eluding the officers.  The FBI soon responds, only to find one bank teller dead, another wounded, and the bankâ€™s security guard shot four times, yet still alive.  Forensics teams and investigators collect evidence in and around the bank, as well as attempt to piece together the crime from surveillance videos, as customers inside the bank were unable to provide information.  Once the gunmen had been identified, authorities, aided by SWAT, must apprehend the criminals before they struck again.

There was only one piece of forensic evidence: a washrag carrying pubic lice that the killer used to clean himself after the crime.  Employing an unusual and original method, an FBI expert combed through all the hairs and fibers in the apartment.  He was not only able to determine how long each hair had been there, but which hairs came from the killer and how the crime proceeded. The womanâ€™s nephew, Kirby Anthoney, emerged as the suspect.  Anthoney was convicted on all three counts.

Deadly Paradise: Two couples found themselves on the same deserted island paradise.  But only one couple left alive. Buck Walker and Stephanie Stearns arrived in Hawaii on the Sea Wind, which belonged to the missing couple, Mac and Muff Graham.  Buck and Stephanie were arrested and served time for boat theft.  But years later, bones were discovered on the deserted island and identified as the remains of Muff Graham. FBI forensic experts testified as to the nature of the bones, the sex of the victim and the injuries that led to her death. Buck Walker was convicted of murder and Stephanie Stearns acquitted in what became known as one of the FBIâ€™s most complex and high profile cases.

The Crazy Don: He wandered the streets of New York City wearing only pajamas and a bathrobe, but the FBI was convinced that Vince Gigante, the reputed boss of the Genovese crime family, was anything but crazy.  The FBI used undercover surveillance, secret audio tapes, six mobsters turned government informants and the testimony of twelve FBI agents to help convict Gigante of murder and conspiracy-to-murder, including a plot to kill rival mob boss John Gotti.

The â€œTeflon Donâ€ felt secure in his position, always remaining one step ahead of the law.  But he was also the ongoing obsession of Bruce Mouw, leader of an elite crew of FBI agents formed to bring down the Gambino family.

Gotti was sentenced to life without parole.

Each had been sitting in their patrol cars when a man sneaked up and opened fire. The FBI was brought in to help catch the cop killer.  Agents identified the man who was most likely the killer, but he was nowhere to be found.  Months of surveillance operations around the country finally yielded a break; they found their suspect in Baltimore, MD.  A task force assembled to make the arrest.  Unfortunately, the killer was one step ahead. He found an unsuspecting agent and gunned him down as he sat in his vehicle waiting to make an arrest. A violent gun battle began. The assassinâ€™s reign was ended with an FBI bullet.

Deadly Stranger (S03E12): Beginning in California in 1995, a serial killer targeted vulnerable women.  At first charming and generous, he quickly became violent.  He was brutal with his kills and quick in his getaways.  Traveling across the country, he struck in Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida.  The FBI and local police needed to stop this cross-country killer before more women fell victim to his insatiable rage.

Held Hostage (S05E09): In October 1995, a South Carolina family was taken hostage as part of an elaborately planned bank robbery.  Local police quickly identified two of the perpetrators, but the criminal mastermind proved more elusive.  After his escape from custody, authorities began to suspect the fugitive of involvement in a series of bank robberies up and down the east coast, and the FBI remained on his trail, hoping to catch him before he took more hostages.

Murderous Girlfriends | TRIPLE EPISODE | The FBI Files,7-ndIubKHfM,The FBI Files,2024-06-02T17:00:08Z,"No Place to Hide (S06E11): In the Spring of 1997, a killer preying on senior citizens terrorizes the River Parish area of Southern Louisiana.  By May, local police and the New Orleans FBI are exploring a connection between the April 9 murder of a 71-year old widow and the May 9 murder of a retired couple.  A month later, authorities forward information on the crimes to the FBIâ€™s Behavioral Science Unit in Quantico, VA, hoping a profile will help them narrow the field of possible suspects.  In July an elderly couple survives a violent attack.  Like the other victims they were robbed, beaten, shot, and left for dead.  Their description of the assailant aids investigators in what have been dubbed the â€œAirline Highway Slayings.â€  By September, police and FBI agents working the case link two past murders from March and May to the case, bringing the body count to five.  A casino worker calls, and names a possible suspect.  Investigators had already been looking into the man, an area mechanic with a gambling problem and connections to several of the victims.  FBI agents and local authorities arrest him in Texas in November, 1997 along with his girlfriend.  After several hours of questioning, he confesses to six killings.

Dead Run (S06E02): A man is found suffocated in his Pennsylvania home, his checkbook, credit cards and vehicle appear to have been stolen.  Fingerprints from the victim identify a recent escapee from a minimum-security prison, as well as his girlfriend.  Investigators flag the dead manâ€™s credit cards, and are alerted when one is used in North Dakota.  The FBI is called in and joins another task force already assembled because of a suspected kidnapping.  Authorities track the stolen card users to several locations in western states, and eventually dangerously close to the Mexican border.  A chase to stop the felons from getting across the border ensues, ending with the two killers in custody.

Family Secrets (S02E11): A young mother and her infant son mysteriously disappeared from their home.  The womanâ€™s husband was the only suspect, but he was eventually cleared. There was no solid evidence that a crime had even been committed.  Six months later, a local farmer found the remains of the missing woman and her child.  Both had been murdered.  Agents and local police had only one tiny piece of evidence, an unidentified hair found in the murdered womanâ€™s car.  The hair was too small for analysis. FBI lab examiners developed a new DNA technique and finally ended the mystery. The husbandâ€™s jealous ex-girlfriend had senselessly murdered the woman and her son.

The Coffee Shop Murders: In July 1997, a triple murder terrified residents in the nationâ€™s capital. In a Georgetown coffee shop, three employees were shot to death. Investigators could find no immediate suspects and no clear motive for the attack. Evidence at the crime scene pointed in many different directions. Was this a hate crime, a robbery gone wrong, or an act of cold-blooded vengeance against one of the victims? Metro D.C. police turned to the FBI for help. They hoped the Bureauâ€™s technical expertise could bring justice for the victims of the triple homicide.

Each had been sitting in their patrol cars when a man sneaked up and opened fire. The FBI was brought in to help catch the cop killer.  Agents identified the man who was most likely the killer, but he was nowhere to be found.  Months of surveillance operations around the country finally yielded a break; they found their suspect in Baltimore, MD.  A task force assembled to make the arrest.  Unfortunately, the killer was one step ahead. He found an unsuspecting agent and gunned him down as he sat in his vehicle waiting to make an arrest. A violent gun battle began. The assassinâ€™s reign was ended with an FBI bullet. 

.22 Caliber Killer: Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.  Using the profile, agents determined a seemingly unrelated event in Georgia was also the work of the .22 caliber killer.  The profile matched the suspect on every point.  It was enough to put the killer away for life.

Investigators quickly discovered that the victim was a dissident member of a religious sect headed by a man calling himself Yahweh ben Yahweh, or God, Son of God.  Although the FBI believed Yahweh ben Yahweh and his followers were responsible for many murders, they could find no direct evidence linking them to the crimes.  Agents knew they had but one recourse: to convince one of the cult leaderâ€™s fanatical followers to betray a man he considered a god.

Deadly Heist (S04E06): In Arizona, a shipment of money vanished into the high desert, along with the two men hired to guard it.  The FBI didnâ€™t know if the guards were participants or victims of an ambush.  Answers lay somewhere in the thousands of square miles of Arizonaâ€™s northwest territory.  When the vehicle was recovered with three hundred thousand dollars and the drivers missing, suspicions that the crime was an inside job grew.  FBI agents struggled to piece together scattered clues to reveal the truth about what happened to the missing men and the location of the missing money.

Deadly Influence (S05E18): Amid the cocaine wars of early 1980â€™s Miami, three dead bodies led a multi-agency tactical squad to suspect that a group of cops might be involved in illegal drug busts.   Investigating rumors of corruption, the squad uncovered a ring of patrolmen who were making millions by ripping off smuggled cocaine.  The investigators set out to prove that even with the advantages wealth and the protection of a police badge, nobody is above the law.

To locate the murderer, agents had to learn more about the secretive group.

When this prediction came true, the FBI agent noted behavioral clues, hoping that they could lead him to the kidnapper.

The robbers kill both guards and seize $5,000.  As the killers run to their getaway car, a police officer arrives and opens fire, striking one escaping assailant in the leg.  After loosing the killers in a chase, police collect blood left by the injured robber and bullet casings from the firefight.  Las Vegas Police and the FBI notice similarities to brazen midday robberies at the MGM Grand casino, the Desert Inn casino and the Mandalay Bay casino.  The FBI developed a list of suspects after the September 20, 1998 MGM Grand robbery.  In that heist, two armed men stormed the casino, broke into its main cage, and stole $350,000.  A month later, a recent parolee with a $10,000 income, purchased a $169,000 home in the name of his wifeâ€™s relative.  Investigatorsâ€™ suspicions of the suspects increased after robbers opened fire on two armored guards in front of the Desert Inn casino on June 28, 1999.  Police found the robberâ€™s getaway car at the nearby Vagabond Inn parked next to an abandoned truck that belonged to one of the suspectsâ€™ brother-in-law.

Camden Police respond and track the suspects to a nearby park.  One of the men shoots at the officer before police arrest his accomplice.  The man gives up the identity of the shooter. Twice, police stake out homes where they believe the shooter is hiding, but he eludes them.  Soon after, Camden Police get a tip that the man is planning to rob the Woodlyne branch of CoreStates Bank with other men.  The FBI surveils the bank for weeks, but with no results.  Then, at 10 am on July 19, 1997, three masked men enter the bank armed with assault rifles.  After terrorizing tellers and customers, the robbers escape with $64,039.  Over the course of the next year, the FBI would chase the elusive thieves, eventually catching them, but only after several more banks are burglarized.

The Shootist: (S07E04) In the late 1980s, the FBI matches wits with a cunning bank robber -- a lone gunman responsible for the longest string of unsolved bank robberies in FBI history.  The robber's planning is meticulous.  He executes his crimes with military precision.

Undercover agents then made their arrests within six days of the bombing. The FBI labs were essential in linking the chemicals from the bomb to chemicals found in the suspectsâ€™ homes and offices.  Mohammed Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Mahmud Abouhalima, Ahmad Ajaj, Ramzi Yousef and Eyad Ismoil were convicted and will spend the rest of their lives in prison.

The True Story of Mississippi Burning (S01E06): On June 21, 1964, three civil rights workers, two white and one black disappeared in Mississippi while passing through Neshoba County. A massive FBI investigation led to the recovery of the bodies of the slain men and physical evidence was recovered and analyzed. The FBI labs confirmed that all but one of the bullets used to kill the men came from the same gun. The FBI gained the trust of an informant, whose information led to the conviction of seven local Ku Klux Klan members.

An employee believed she recognized the voice of one of the robbers, and FBI agents began conducting surveillance on a former employee of the facility.  With only one piece of physical evidence, a fragment of a vehicle taillight, authorities hoped to connect him to the crime, and locate his accomplices.

Home Invaders: In the early 1980â€™s, a pair of serial bank robbers gained a reputation among law enforcement officials as formidable bandits.  Using the same modus operandi, the two men took hostages and emptied bank vaults across the Midwest.  After the criminals escaped from police custody, FBI agents familiar with the bandits believed that they would attempt a grand-scale heist.  By conducting surveillance on known associates of the criminals, authorities tried to anticipate the next target.

Held Hostage: In October 1995, a South Carolina family was taken hostage as part of an elaborately planned bank robbery.  Local police quickly identified two of the perpetrators, but the criminal mastermind proved more elusive.  After his escape from custody, authorities began to suspect the fugitive of involvement in a series of bank robberies up and down the east coast, and the FBI remained on his trail, hoping to catch him before he took more hostages.

Two masked men brandishing automatic weapons confront, and open fire on officers responding to the call.  The gunmen exit the bank, and retreat on foot, eventually eluding the officers.  The FBI soon responds, only to find one bank teller dead, another wounded, and the bankâ€™s security guard shot four times, yet still alive.  Forensics teams and investigators collect evidence in and around the bank, as well as attempt to piece together the crime from surveillance videos, as customers inside the bank were unable to provide information.  Once the gunmen had been identified, authorities, aided by SWAT, must apprehend the criminals before they struck again.  

Dead Run: A man is found suffocated in his Pennsylvania home, his checkbook, credit cards and vehicle appear to have been stolen.  Fingerprints from the victim identify a recent escapee from a minimum-security prison, as well as his girlfriend.  Investigators flag the dead manâ€™s credit cards, and are alerted when one is used in North Dakota.  The FBI is called in and joins another task force already assembled because of a suspected kidnapping.  Authorities track the stolen card users to several locations in western states, and eventually dangerously close to the Mexican border.  A chase to stop the felons from getting across the border ensues, ending with the two killers in custody.

Brutal Abduction: In Wisconsin, a varsity athlete is blindfolded, gagged, and shoved into a van by four gunmen.  The kidnappers contact the victimâ€™s family and demand $30,000, but offer no instructions on how to transfer the money.  The victimâ€™s family contacts the police.  The boyâ€™s captors tell his family they have shot him, and will kill him if they do not receive their money.  At an agreed upon drop site, FBI agents approach the captorâ€™s vehicle, only to watch them flee and quickly be followed by authorities.  The gang dumps the boyâ€™s body in a used car lot just before they are arrested.  Unfortunately for the victim who did not survive the ordeal, he had been targeted by mistake by a group who owed drug debts, and thought the athlete was involved in the same illegal activities.

By May, local police and the New Orleans FBI are exploring a connection between the April 9 murder of a 71-year old widow and the May 9 murder of a retired couple.  A month later, authorities forward information on the crimes to the FBIâ€™s Behavioral Science Unit in Quantico, VA, hoping a profile will help them narrow the field of possible suspects.  In July an elderly couple survives a violent attack.  Like the other victims they were robbed, beaten, shot, and left for dead.  Their description of the assailant aids investigators in what have been dubbed the â€œAirline Highway Slayings.â€  By September, police and FBI agents working the case link two past murders from March and May to the case, bringing the body count to five.  A casino worker calls, and names a possible suspect.  Investigators had already been looking into the man, an area mechanic with a gambling problem and connections to several of the victims.  FBI agents and local authorities arrest him in Texas in November, 1997 along with his girlfriend.  After several hours of questioning, he confesses to six killings.

Lawless: (S05E07) On October 2, 1987, a Boston police officer responding to a domestic disturbance call was fatally wounded.  Local authorities launched a citywide manhunt, but were only able to find the fingerprints of the chief suspect.  Believing that he had fled the area, the FBI followed the suspectâ€™s trail to the west coast and then across the Mexican border, always aware of the desperation of a cop killer and of the need for justice.

In Pursuit: (S05E03) In Lincoln County, Nebraska, a fugitive drug dealer engaged in a shootout with state troopers, wounding two of them, and eluded capture after a high-speed chase.  Authorities immediately set up a statewide manhunt, connecting the fugitive to a murder in western Nebraska.  A chance sighting led FBI agents to a second confrontation with the killer, who was more determined than ever to escape the law.

Florida Vs The FBI | TRIPLE EPISODE | The FBI Files,pRbLikzXpDA,The FBI Files,2024-05-17T17:00:41Z,"Killing Spree (S01E08): The rapes and murders of ten women near Tampa, Florida in 1984 had the authorities puzzled and the community scared.   Since the beginning, the FBI had been analyzing the crime scene evidence and had found a common link: red trilobal carpet fibers.  But there was no suspect, until one of the killerâ€™s potential victims survived.  Through her interviews and the cooperation of local authorities and the FBI, 31-year-old Bobby Joe Long emerged as the prime suspect.  Fibers from his car and those found on the lone survivor matched those at the crime scenes.  Long was convicted of eight of the murders and rapes.

A Model Killer (S02E01): In 1984, south Miami became the home for a sadistic serial killer.  Posing as a fashion photographer, Christopher Wilder lured young women from shopping malls with promises of fame and fortune.  Most ended up dead.  As the FBI closed in around him, Wilder took off on a cross-country murderous rampage.  The FBI added Wilder to their Most Wanted Fugitives program.  The chase was on, and Wilder ultimately lost.  What stopped the serial killer was not brilliant or sophisticated police work, but national publicity that the FBI created.

Killer Abroad (S02E14); Beginning in summer of 1990, the bodies of several women began turning up in and around the city of Vienna, Austria. From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.  With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.  An international manhunt was underway.  The killer, Jack Unterweger, a celebrated writer in his native Germany was tracked down and arrested in Miami, Florida.

Lured by the easy wealth of the narcotics industry, crooked cops began breaking the laws they were sworn to uphold.  They would stop at nothing, including murder, to protect their rackets.  When it became clear they could no longer police themselves, the FBI got involved.  Putting their lives on the line, undercover agents devised a way to flush out the violent cops and restore trust in the cityâ€™s police force.

Inside the Bureau: (S6E15) When violent criminals strike, the FBI strikes back, employing every available resource, and creating new ones when necessary.  From forensic science to criminal profiling, specialized intelligence to global fugitive tracking, the agents of the FBI battle the bad guys with a most powerful arsenal: the crime-fighterâ€™s toolbox.  This special episode of The FBI Files celebrates the groundbreaking science, investigative technique, and gut-level instinct that has made the FBI the worldâ€™s premier law enforcement agency.  Dedicated agents on the streets and scientists in the lab use their collective talents to accomplish the FBIâ€™s mission of ensuring justice for the American people in the most creative and effective ways possible.

Independence Day Breakout: (S7E14) In 1987, Seven inmates break out of a high security prison in New Mexico. The escapees, all violent criminals, are a threat to anyone who crosses their path. State and local police and the FBI know they must capture these men before they rob, rape and killâ€¦again.

In 1980, the FBI began a massive undercover operation, code named â€œSafebet,â€ that was designed to expose the Chicago Mafiaâ€™s infiltration into the cityâ€™s surrounding suburbs. Undercover agents quickly discovered that the mob had its tentacles spread into every facet of the law enforcement community.  Agents refocused and sought to expose the corrupt politicians and police.  They unwittingly uncovered the murder of a wealthy socialite perpetrated by a jealous and greedy mob lawyer and covered up by the local police chief.  The conspiracy gave the FBI the leverage they needed to break up the mobâ€™s stranglehold in the suburbs.

On August 20, 1980, an unseen sniper murdered two young black men as they jogged with two white women in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Police threw all their resources into finding a killer who left almost no clues behind.  They met with FBI agents and detectives from around the country who had similar racially motivated sniper slayings.  A month later, working off little more than a possible license plate number, police in Kentucky arrested Joseph Paul Franklin but the man escaped from custody.  The FBI placed Franklin on their Ten Most Wanted list, and an intense manhunt began.  The white supremacist killer, responsible for as many as 20 murders, was arrested two months later by FBI agents in Tampa, Florida.

01:40:00 - S2E18
Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.  Using the profile, agents determined a seemingly unrelated event in Georgia was also the work of the .22 caliber killer.  The profile matched the suspect on every point.  It was enough to put the killer away for life.

On June 21, 1964, three civil rights workers, two white and one black disappeared in Mississippi while passing through Neshoba County. A massive FBI investigation led to the recovery of the bodies of the slain men and physical evidence was recovered and analyzed. The FBI labs confirmed that all but one of the bullets used to kill the men came from the same gun. The FBI gained the trust of an informant, whose information led to the conviction of seven local Ku Klux Klan members.

On February 26, 1993, an explosion rocked the World Trade Center parking garage.  Six people died and more than a thousand were injured in the bomb blast that tore a 5-story crater in the building.  During the investigation, the twisted fender of a rental van was extracted from the rubble.  The FBI was able to determine from where the van was rented and by whom.  Undercover agents then made their arrests within six days of the bombing. The FBI labs were essential in linking the chemicals from the bomb to chemicals found in the suspectsâ€™ homes and offices.  Mohammed Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Mahmud Abouhalima, Ahmad Ajaj, Ramzi Yousef and Eyad Ismoil were convicted and will spend the rest of their lives in prison.

In the early â€˜90s, Washington, D.C. police were losing the battle against street gangs who enforced their territories with lethal violence.  The homicide rate in the nationâ€™s capital climbed to the highest in the country.  Local police turned to the FBI for help, but agents soon found themselves in the direct line of fire.  In the fall of 1994, a gang member walked into police headquarters, killed two FBI agents and one detective, then turned the gun on himself.  Authorities vowed to bring the entire gang to justice, but discovered that the leader had fled to Africa.  Agents were uncertain if they could find the fugitive and bring him in.

Two men died and more than a dozen were injured, but Ted Kaczynski wasnâ€™t known as the Unabomber until his brother tipped off the FBI.  Kaczynskiâ€™s â€œUnabomber Manifesto,â€ published in major newspapers, set off a flurry of activity for the FBI: writing analysis and comparisons, DNA gleaned from a single postage stamp and finally, Kaczynskiâ€™s arrest at his tiny cabin.  The agents collected enough evidence, including the â€œManifestoâ€ itself, to convict Kaczynski.  He is serving four life sentences plus 30 years with no chance of parole.

In June 1985, the terrorist and his four accomplices hijacked Royal Jordanian flight #405 shortly before take off in Beirut, Lebanon.  On board were American citizens, a professor and his teen son.  The FBI opened a criminal investigation and worked with various other government agencies to form Operation Goldenrod, a task force specifically charged with bringing the terrorist to justice in 1989.

Deadly Payout (S07E08): In 1980, extortionists plant a thousand pound bomb in a Nevada casino and demand millions of dollars, or they will detonate the device.

The Biggest Pennsylvania Cases | DOUBLE EPISODE | The FBI Files,fwfesq_9RGw,The FBI Files,2024-08-24T13:00:45Z,"A Stranger in Town: (S02E05) Local law enforcement became stumped when the body of an unidentified young woman turned up on a highway in their small Pennsylvania town. They turned to the FBI labs. The hi-tech lab enabled investigators and agents to identify the victim. Knowing who she was allowed agents to reconstruct her every move. Though the road to finding her killer was twisted and long, agents persisted. They finally came face to face with the young womanâ€™s killer, a man they determined was responsible for several other murders.

Dead Run: (S06E02) A man is found suffocated in his Pennsylvania home, his checkbook, credit cards and vehicle appear to have been stolen.  Fingerprints from the victim identify a recent escapee from a minimum-security prison, as well as his girlfriend.

The FBI is called in and joins another task force already assembled because of a suspected kidnapping.  Authorities track the stolen card users to several locations in western states, and eventually dangerously close to the Mexican border.  A chase to stop the felons from getting across the border ensues, ending with the two killers in custody.

As the FBI closed in around him, Wilder took off on a cross-country murderous rampage.  The FBI added Wilder to their Most Wanted Fugitives program.  The chase was on, and Wilder ultimately lost.  What stopped the serial killer was not brilliant or sophisticated police work, but national publicity that the FBI created.

Her mother hoped Pasadena, Texas police could find her before it was too late.  Six months later, their worst fear was realized when a farmer discovered the young girlâ€™s remains in an Illinois barn.  The FBI was called in to help.

Agents suspected that her powerful ex-lover was responsible, but they had little physical evidence to support their theory.  Investigators never found the womanâ€™s body or the murder weapon.  The FBIâ€™s only hope was to go undercover, and turn brother against brother.  

First and Kennedy Street Crew: (S03E03) In the early â€˜90s, Washington, D.C. police were losing the battle against street gangs who enforced their territories with lethal violence.  The homicide rate in the nationâ€™s capital climbed to the highest in the country.  Local police turned to the FBI for help, but agents soon found themselves in the direct line of fire.  In the fall of 1994, a gang member walked into police headquarters, killed two FBI agents and one detective, then turned the gun on himself.  Authorities vowed to bring the entire gang to justice, but discovered that the leader had fled to Africa.  Agents were uncertain if they could find the fugitive and bring him in.

"The Biggest Hawaii, Utah & Wisconsin Cases | TRIPLE EPISODE | The FBI Files",KNvw7262x5Y,The FBI Files,2024-08-23T13:00:31Z,"Deadly Paradise: (S01E05) Two couples found themselves on the same deserted island paradise. But only one couple left alive. Buck Walker and Stephanie Stearns arrived in Hawaii on the Sea Wind, which belonged to the missing couple, Mac and Muff Graham. Buck and Stephanie were arrested and served time for boat theft. But years later, bones were discovered on the deserted island and identified as the remains of Muff Graham. FBI forensic experts testified as to the nature of the bones, the sex of the victim and the injuries that led to her death. Buck Walker was convicted of murder and Stephanie Stearns acquitted in what became known as one of the FBIâ€™s most complex and high profile cases.

Moving Target: (S02E15) On August 20, 1980, an unseen sniper murdered two young black men as they jogged with two white women in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Police threw all their resources into finding a killer who left almost no clues behind.  They met with FBI agents and detectives from around the country who had similar racially motivated sniper slayings.  A month later, working off little more than a possible license plate number, police in Kentucky arrested Joseph Paul Franklin but the man escaped from custody.  The FBI placed Franklin on their Ten Most Wanted list, and an intense manhunt began.  The white supremacist killer, responsible for as many as 20 murders, was arrested two months later by FBI agents in Tampa, Florida.

Brutal Abduction: (S06E03) In Wisconsin, a varsity athlete is blindfolded, gagged, and shoved into a van by four gunmen.  The kidnappers contact the victimâ€™s family and demand $30,000, but offer no instructions on how to transfer the money.  The victimâ€™s family contacts the police.  The boyâ€™s captors tell his family they have shot him, and will kill him if they do not receive their money.  At an agreed upon drop site, FBI agents approach the captorâ€™s vehicle, only to watch them flee and quickly be followed by authorities.  The gang dumps the boyâ€™s body in a used car lot just before they are arrested.  Unfortunately for the victim who did not survive the ordeal, he had been targeted by mistake by a group who owed drug debts, and thought the athlete was involved in the same illegal activities.

In an environment of violence and fear it would be difficult to identify, arrest and convict those involved in the secretive and deadly world of big money drugs.

A Bank Robbery and A Maximum Security Prison Escape | FULL EPISODE | The FBI Files,czBSe4qeLEw,The FBI Files,2024-11-10T18:00:32Z,"Without Mercy: At 9:30 am on the morning of January 30, 1997, Richmond, VA police respond to a report of shots fired at a local bank.  Two masked men brandishing automatic weapons confront, and open fire on officers responding to the call.  The gunmen exit the bank, and retreat on foot, eventually eluding the officers.  The FBI soon responds, only to find one bank teller dead, another wounded, and the bankâ€™s security guard shot four times, yet still alive.  Forensics teams and investigators collect evidence in and around the bank, as well as attempt to piece together the crime from surveillance videos, as customers inside the bank were unable to provide information.  Once the gunmen had been identified, authorities, aided by SWAT, must apprehend the criminals before they struck again.  

Dead Run: A man is found suffocated in his Pennsylvania home, his checkbook, credit cards and vehicle appear to have been stolen.  Fingerprints from the victim identify a recent escapee from a minimum-security prison, as well as his girlfriend.  Investigators flag the dead manâ€™s credit cards, and are alerted when one is used in North Dakota.  The FBI is called in and joins another task force already assembled because of a suspected kidnapping.  Authorities track the stolen card users to several locations in western states, and eventually dangerously close to the Mexican border.  A chase to stop the felons from getting across the border ensues, ending with the two killers in custody.

Brutal Abduction: In Wisconsin, a varsity athlete is blindfolded, gagged, and shoved into a van by four gunmen.  The kidnappers contact the victimâ€™s family and demand $30,000, but offer no instructions on how to transfer the money.  The victimâ€™s family contacts the police.  The boyâ€™s captors tell his family they have shot him, and will kill him if they do not receive their money.  At an agreed upon drop site, FBI agents approach the captorâ€™s vehicle, only to watch them flee and quickly be followed by authorities.  The gang dumps the boyâ€™s body in a used car lot just before they are arrested.  Unfortunately for the victim who did not survive the ordeal, he had been targeted by mistake by a group who owed drug debts, and thought the athlete was involved in the same illegal activities.

Donald Trump DECLASSIFIES All FBI Files Related To Crossfire Hurricane Investigation,iTPmxW66AnQ,TRUMPS BRIEFS in 30SECS,2025-03-26T17:00:50Z,"Trump declassifies all Crossfire Hurricane FBI files on Mar 25, calls probe corrupt, some redacted.
President Donald Trump took a bold step on March 25, 2025. Trump signed an order to declassify all FBI files from the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, a 2016 look into his campaignâ€™s supposed Russia ties. Trump called it corrupt, saying it was a disgrace that hurt his first term (Fox News). Trumpâ€™s White House made it official, though some parts stay hidden due to earlier FBI requests.
Trump has long pushed this fight. He first tried declassifying these files in 2021, but they stayed locked up under Biden (WhiteHouse.gov). Now, Trump says this shows how the FBI was used against him. The cause is Trumpâ€™s belief that the truth must come out, a promise he made to his supporters.
The aftermath could be big. Trumpâ€™s move might show mistakes by the FBI, changing how people trust it. Some think Trumpâ€™s just settling scores, but others say it could lead to reforms. Trumpâ€™s order puts the spotlight back on 2016, and by mid-2025, it might reshape views of his leadership. Trumpâ€™s action keeps this old story alive for everyone to see.
